Any process where the output is not in direct proportion to the input can be called non-linear.

In fact, very few processes of nature are linear. As used in this material, the term non-linear refers to processes where a very small change at the beginning makes a large qualitative difference at the end. The straw that breaks the camel's back is a proverbial example of a non-linear process. The often heard adage about the beat of butterfly wings triggering a hurricane on the other side of the world is another.

The [[FOTCM|FOTCM]] proposes that consciousness as expressed in individual actions have a non-linear effect on reality, specially at times of turmoil and chaos where reality is naturally more malleable. Such times occur cyclically and the present time is rapidly progressing in such a direction.

The FotCM proposes that the quality of observership brought into the process by suitably developed consciousness may make a radical difference in the outcome of the period of chaos.
