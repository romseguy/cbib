Event Enhanced Quantum Theory (EEQT) is an attempt at bridging between the quantum and classical worlds in physics. Quantum theory predicts probabilities for events but in itself does not contain a notion of irreversible event. The notion of event becomes possible only via the introduction of a classical outside observer, something not a part of the quantum system being described. Thus the notion of event, measurement, observer and interface of classical and quantum systems are inextricably linked. The notion of irreversible event is a cornerstone of classical physics, as in the second law of thermodynamics, which states that all systems tend towards entropy. This does not however have a counterpart at the quantum scale.

The question of the boundary of quantum and classical has multiple essential ramifications. One of these is offering a model for the interaction of time, matter and consciousness. We remember that events cannot be defined without recourse to the notion of observer. On the other hand, for obtaining a unified view of physics, i.e. unified field theory, combining the different worlds of relativity and quantum theory is required.

From the [[FOTCM|FOTCM]]'s angle, these questions are essential in offering a scientific model for things such as the Wave, how the quality of observation influences reality, how reality may undergo 'phase changes,' how order may arise from chaos as a result of conscious observation and so forth. All these questions relate to the interface of the quantum substrate of reality and the observer. Another key question of physics pertaining to these topics is the possible existence of quantum-like transitions at the macro scale, as in planetary systems and the possible effect of "quantum observership" on these.

The theory has been developed by physicists [[Arkadiusz Jadczyk]] and Philip Blanchard. Much additional material is available at [Quantum Future website](http://www.quantumfuture.net/).
