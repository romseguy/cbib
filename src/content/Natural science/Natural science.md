All ‘Natural science’ topics
----------------------------

*   [[Antimatter]] (Antimatter is material composed of elementary particles of equal mass but opposite electrical charge.)
*   [[Big Bang]] (Emergence of the entire universe of matter and energy from a primal explosion where a point of infinite density, a so-called singularity, exploded and gave rise to all of what we consider to be the universe.)
*   [[Black hole]] (An object near which the gravity field is so intense that the escape velocity exceeds the velocity of light.)
*   [[Bose-Einstein condensate]] (A unique state of matter that forms below a critical temperature in which all bosons that comprise the matter fall into the same quantum state.)
*   [[Cataclysm]] (Cataclysms occur at very different scales.)
*   [[Color spectrum]] (Visible light corresponds to a range of wavelengths of electromagnetic radiation from about 400 for red to 800 nanometers for indigo.)
*   [[Comet cluster]]
*   [[Dimension]] (A dimension is not simply an axis perpendicular to all other axis of the space in question. Dimensions can be linear or cyclic, finite or infinite.)
*   [[Energy]] (In physics, energy means capacity to do work.)
*   [[Entropy]] (In physics, entropy refers to the amount of order in a given system. Irreversible processes, such as combustion increase entropy.)
*   [[Event Enhanced Quantum Theory]] (EEQT is an attempt at bridging between the quantum and classical worlds in physics.)
*   [[Game theory]] (This is a branch of mathematics which explores outcomes of choices within "games", i.e. systems with formal rules, participants, a space of possible actions and typically some sort of score function.)
*   [[Gravity]] (Gravity is everywhere but the mechanism through which it propagates is not known.)
*   [[HAARP]] (HAARP refers to a United States military-operated research site in Alaska, and used for space and time manipulation as well as mind control of the masses.)
*   [[Holographic nature]] (A hologram is an image which appears to have depth because its appearance changes according to the angle of observation.)
*   [[Hyperdimensional physics]] (The term generally refers to theories of physics involving more than three dimensions of space and one of time.)
*   [[Many-worlds interpretation]] (One interpretation of quantum theory is that each time a measurement is made, all possible outcomes of the measurement occur, each in its own parallel world.)
*   [[Matrix]] (The word has a number of different uses, but is often used in the present work to refer to the 'matrix control system', a metaphorical description of humanity's situation drawing upon the film _The Matrix_.)
*   [[Maunder Minimum]] (A period named after the English solar astronomer E.W. Maunder, who charted an interval of drastically reduced sunspot activity between the years of 1645 and 1715.)
*   [[Mitochondrial DNA]] (This is a section of DNA which is inherited from the mother exclusively.)
*   [[Monoatomic gold]] (Monoatomic gold refers to a gold powder so fine that it consists of single atoms not joined by metal bonds to neighboring gold atoms.)
*   [[Neutrino]] (The neutrino is a type of fundamental particle with no electric charge, a very small mass, and one-half unit of spin.)
*   [[Nonlinear system]] (Any process where the output is not in direct proportion to the input can be called non-linear.)
*   [[Orgone energy]] (This term was introduced by Wilhelm Reich and refers to a subtle form of energy that acts as a sort of organizing principle for natural phenomena.)
*   [[Particle]] (In particle physics, a particle is a basic unit of matter and energy.)
*   [[Particle physics]] (Particle physics is a branch of physics that studies the elementary constituents of matter and radiation, and the interactions between them.)
*   [[Pineal gland]] (The pineal gland is a reddish colored cone-shaped mass of about 8 mm in diameter, located deep inside the brain.)
*   [[Planck constant]] (A physical constant that is the quantum of action in quantum mechanics.)
*   [[Pole shift]] (A common theme in various predictions of Earth changes, the pole shift refers to more than the switching of the magnetic poles.)
*   [[Positive vs. negative feedback]] (Positive feedback is when a system's output keeps feeding its input (which may e.g. cause the output to grow exponentially), while negative feedback is when a system counteracts changes in its output to keep the system stable. These concepts can be used to describe aspects of the human condition, both individually and collectively.)
*   [[Quantum physics]] (The scientific study of sub-atomic reality.)
*   [[Quantum tunneling]]
*   [[Rigel]] (Rigel (Beta Orionis) is a supergiant.)
*   [[Technology]] (The role of technology in the development of consciousness is somewhat complex and ambiguous.)
*   [[Unified Field Theory]] (A type of field theory that allows all fundamental forces and elementary particles to be written in terms of a single field.)
*   [[White dwarves and supernovae]]
*   [[Zero-point energy and field]]
