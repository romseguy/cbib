**Game theory** is a branch of mathematics which explores outcomes of choices within "games", i.e. systems with formal rules, participants, a space of possible actions and typically some sort of score function.

Game theory can be applied for simulating human interactions and for analyzing which strategies provide the best result under which circumstances. Games may involve various degrees of sharing or withholding of information between players, cooperation, altruistic and egotistic strategies, unpredictability of circumstance and so forth. Game theory is a formal framework for analyzing situations and strategies as may apply to politics, economy, warfare and other fields of human activity.

The best known early developers of game theory were John von Neumann and John Nash. The Princeton Institute for Advanced Study was an important early locus of development.

Game theory is an important tool in the manipulation of economy and politics by the world powers and a certain understanding of this and the related modes of thinking is necessary for informed analysis of these.

The Princeton IAS is probably one of the earliest think tanks connected to the "[[Consortium|consortium]]" or "secret government". Game theory is certainly a domain of interest and important tool for these parties. Much other research, including covert research on hyperdimensional physics is likely to have taken place at the IAS. We note John von Neumann's alleged involvement in the [[Philadelphia Experiment]] and other activities of the sort. John Nash's mental illness and self-claimed receiving of scientific information via a sort of inner voice indicates the possibility of unconscious channeling. The entities behind this phenomenon, given the context and direction of research may well have been [[Fourth density service to self being|fourth density service to self beings]].
