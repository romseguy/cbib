Ponerology and psychopathy

**Ponerology** (see [[Ponerology|ponerology]] and _[[Political Ponerology]]_) is the scientific study of evil and its genesis, and its most important finding is that psychopaths play a main role in causing the suffering and inhumanity seen in the world at present and throughout history. **Psychopaths** (see [[Psychopathy|psychopathy]]) are born without [[Conscience|conscience]] and lack the ability to ever develop one. They are completely unable to empathize. Often charming and convincing, they act as intraspecies predators – preying on others in the interest of their own greed for power, status, money, and pleasure.

The field of ponerology has its roots in mid-20th century Eastern European clinical psychology. As such, its terminology sometimes differs from the modern, mainstream terminology of psychopathology and psychiatry.

Psychopathy

_See [[psychopathy (ponerology)]] for more information_

Unlike the typical Hollywood portrayal, psychopaths are not necessarily serial killers, nor do they necessarily even do something for which they can be thrown into prison. With their ruthlessness and talent for manipulation, the more 'successful' of psychopaths easily climb the societal ladders of business, politics, religion, etc. – generally at great cost to others throughout their sphere of influence. In our present world, psychopaths have formed a [[pathocracy]] – rule by a pathological minority – and the overall state of the world, including politics, reflects this.

This phenomenon is nothing new – it seems to be a repeating pattern throughout human history. Like a parasite, a psychopathic minority can feed off of the resources of others as long it doesn't grow too large: as long as the host population survives, it is a successful evolutionary strategy. While civilizations repeatedly rise and fall under the influence of psychopaths, humanity lives on, and so do the pathological few who immediately set out to rebuild their power over others whenever the existing structure crumbles.

Ponerology distinguishes between several types of genetically inherited psychopathy; essential psychopathy corresponds to the modern definition of psychopathy, while other types have somewhat different characteristics. All types involve a deficiency of conscience and empathy, and due to their particular deformed ways of psychologically relating to others, exert a destructive influence.

Characteropathy

_See [[Characteropathy|characteropathy]] for more information_

Ponerology also studies other types of (in more mainstream terminology) personality disorders, and their effects on others including their role in the genesis of evil.

_See [[pathocracy]] for more information._

Pathocracy means rule by a pathological minority – ultimately, psychopaths take the top positions in such a system. The Western world has turned into a pathocracy on the largest scale – with a center of power in the USA and some of its most closely allied nations, the hold of which has spread around the world through 'globalization'. This system inflicts great suffering worldwide in the interest of the greed of the unscrupulous few.

The overall result, in modern history, of the immense influence of psychopaths on the state of the world – as observable all around us – is described in the [[Politics and pathocracy|politics and pathocracy]] series of articles.

*   [[Characteropathy]] (In ponerology, personality disorder that is acquired rather than inherited. Characteropaths play important roles early in the ponerogenic process.)
*   [[Covert aggression]] (Avoiding any overt display of aggression while simultaneously intimidating others into giving you what you want is a powerfully manipulative maneuver, which is why covert-aggression is most often the vehicle for interpersonal manipulation.)
*   [[Ignota nulla curatio morbi]] (Latin for "do not attempt to cure what you do not understand" – an important principle of ponerology.)
*   [[Impression management]] (Impression management is a manipulative process of controlling or influencing the perceptions of other people.)
*   [[Information selection and substitution]] (Largely subconscious processes that distort a person's thinking and conclusions. To avoid uncomfortable conclusions, premises which would lead to them are suppressed and replaced – leading to new and more comfortable, but erroneous, conclusions.)
*   [[Paramoralism]] (A paramoralism is an insincere or deceptive moral argument or line of reasoning. While it may appear ethical, on closer examination it can be seen to be driven by self-interest, or by adherence to a system of rules disregarding conscience.)
*   [[pathocracy]] (Pathocracy is a totalitarian form of government in which absolute political power is held by a psychopathic elite, and their effect on the people is such that the entire society is ruled and motivated by pathological values.)
*   [[Plausible lie]] (99% of all of the problems confronting mankind can be traced to a single cause: the problem of the plausible lie.)
*   [[ponerization]] (The influence of pathological people on individuals and groups whereby they develop acceptance of pathological reasoning and values.)
*   [[Ponerogenic association]] (Any group of people characterized by ponerogenic processes of above-average social intensity, wherein the carriers of various pathological factors function as inspirers, spellbinders, and leaders, and where a proper pathological social structure generates.)
*   [[Ponerology]] (The study of evil. While originally referring to a branch of theology, the modern scientific field of ponerology concerns the scientific study of inhumanity and suffering, and their causes.)
*   [[Psychopathy]] (This personality disorder is puzzling and intractable. Its principal feature seems to be a lack of conscience.)
*   [[Psychopathy (ponerology)]] (Psychopathy was once used to refer to any mental disorder, but in its modern meaning is a psychological construct that describes chronic immoral and antisocial behavior. A psychopath is conscienceless, and, most importantly, this is hidden from view behind a mask of normality that is often so convincing that even experts reportedly are deceived.)
*   [[Reversive blockade]] (A psychological manipulation meant to mislead: by insisting very strongly on the opposite of the truth, the one who uses it prevents many people from considering the truth as a possibility. In following "common sense", many people instead look for the truth "in the middle". The use of this tactic is uncommon among normal people; it is part of the special psychological knowledge developed by psychopaths.)
*   [[Schizoidal declaration]] (The characteristic kind of expression that betrays the psychological worldview of the schizoidal psychopath. Such expressions can often be found in their statements and writings.)
