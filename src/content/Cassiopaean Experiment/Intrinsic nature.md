The term **intrinsic nature** term comes from [[Sufism|Sufi]] tradition and refers to one's built-in tendency towards "felicity" vs. "wretchedness", "grace" vs. "sin", or [[Being vs. non-being|being vs. non-being]].

This corresponds roughly to the [[Cassiopaeans|Cassiopaean]] notion of consciousness energy director. This is the factor determining the binding between the entity and the realm the entity occupies. This corresponds to both [[Density|density]] as well as to the [service to others/service to self]([[Service to others and service to self]]) duality.

At the level of human psychology, such a nature can be seen in one's basic disposition towards either being giving, empathic, and honoring reality, or on the other hand selfish and submerged in [[Wishful thinking|wishful thinking]].
