This word **attack** is used in [[FOTCM]] discourse to denote action of the [[General Law]] towards hampering a person's or group's esoteric work or development.

This may involve an endlessly broad range of circumstances. These will generally not be distinguishable from bad luck or any common adversity. These occur in whichever area one may be most vulnerable. Attack may be evident but its relation to a control system or General Law will almost by definition remain indemonstrable to a third party. This can be akin to a Murphy's law: "If it can go wrong, it will."

An attack is not always a misfortune in the A influence sense, although it often is this too. It can be any temptation, seduction, opportunity involving anything from romance to money to career to following one's noble or altruistic traits.

It can be any trouble, whether being victim of crime, stalking, threats, violence, legal problems, slander, defamation. It may range from constant irritation to immediately life-threatening levels. The objective of the General Law is generally not to literally destroy, except as concerns esoteric development. Its objective is rather to keep people in their place. Of course, death and permanent insanity are also possible outcomes. Often, rather than directly killing, attack may permanently discourage people or scare them away or permanently entrap them to live in a survival oriented mode where they have time for nothing else.

In some cases, attack takes the form of direct hyperdimensional influences. These can involve [[Alien abduction|UFO abduction]], strange psychic occurrences, synchronicities, inexplicable diseases with sudden onset, etc. Demonstrating these to be directed by any outside ill intent is not usually possible within the A influence framework.

Attacks usually involve a "vector" or "portal" of attack. This is a group or person through which the trouble takes place. The expression 'closing portals of attack' means taking precautions against various possible attacks. This would mean avoiding possible legal liabilities, not giving any grounds for rumors, not taking unnecessary risks, etc.

Attack may manifest through anything and everything. It will often take place through persons that are close such as family members. The New Testament has this to say, from the Gospel of Matthew:

**10:34** Think not that I am come to send peace on earth: I came not to send peace, but a sword.

**10:35** For I am come to set a man at variance against his father, and the daughter against her mother, and the daughter in law against her mother in law.

**10:36** And a man's foes shall be they of his own household.

**10:37** He that loveth father or mother more than me is not worthy of me: and he that loveth son or daughter more than me is not worthy of me.

Outside the esoteric context, the General Law may be beneficial and reasonable. The meaning of the above verses refers to the life of one who commits to an esoteric path. The attachments to one's family are not bad, they are even quite necessary. However they will often be hijacked by the General Law and turned against the seeker.

Any defense can only be rooted in awareness of the possibility of attack and in anticipating and preempting these as may be possible.

If the attack consists of criminal or underhanded activity or lies and slander, a possible defense may be to avoid a shouting match and simply expose the facts of the case to all concerned, while not directly addressing the attacker. The lie in this case gets the truth as answer. Propagating lies can be seen in one sense as an asking for truth. Personal integrity is important, as is the attempt to minimize things which could be used to blackmail.

Going to extremes in preventing possible attacks will often in itself satisfy the General Law. Such a situation could include limiting all one's public activity, and/or staying where one is, which effectively maintains the aim of the General Law. Thinking that one can defy the world is hubris; one should take this into account and not attempt to pick fights which will simply get one killed. Thinking that one is smarter than the 'control system' is always an invitation for trouble.

Falling into pervasive paranoia or being disconnected from people may well destroy one's esoteric development. Retaining an ability to trust and to be open within reason is important. It is true that any exclusive dependencies may be used against one and that in general they should be avoided. An esoteric group cannot be formed without trust, hence capacity for trust needs to be preserved despite the control system's discouragement of same. Discernment is critical.

Seeing an attack in an archetypal setting may alleviate the feeling of it being personal. The people involved may simply be taken over by the 'matrix,' at least in figurative terms and their actions may not be strictly personal.

The widespread cointelpro activity directed first against the civil rights movement and student radicals of the 1960-70's and then later against the New Age, UFO and conspiracy scenes offers many case studies of attack. We note that attack is not even principally a spiritual phenomenon and does not in most cases require any 'higher forces.' Challenging the belief structures of people, particularly those people in positions of power is often enough and the regular functioning of the 'predator's mind' takes care of the rest. Although most of the targets in the above cases were not engaged in esoteric activity they still may offer lessons.
