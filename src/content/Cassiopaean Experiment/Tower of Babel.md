From the Book of Genesis:

**11:1** And the whole earth was of one language, and of one speech.

**11:2** And it came to pass, as they journeyed from the east, that they found a plain in the land of Shinar; and they dwelt there.

**11:3** And they said one to another, Go to, let us make brick, and burn them thoroughly. And they had brick for stone, and slime had they for morter.

**11:4** And they said, Go to, let us build us a city and a tower, whose top may reach unto heaven; and let us make us a name, lest we be scattered abroad upon the face of the whole earth.

**11:5** And the LORD came down to see the city and the tower, which the children of men builded.

**11:6** And the LORD said, Behold, the people is one, and they have all one language; and this they begin to do: and now nothing will be restrained from them, which they have imagined to do.

**11:7** Go to, let us go down, and there confound their language, that they may not understand one another's speech.

**11:8** So the LORD scattered them abroad from thence upon the face of all the earth: and they left off to build the city.

**11:9** Therefore is the name of it called Babel; because the LORD did there confound the language of all the earth: and from thence did the LORD scatter them abroad upon the face of all the earth.

On the surface of things, this would appear to be a story about the creation of different spoken and written languages. On closer inspection, it makes more sense to see this as the destruction of spiritual unity. We are not talking about a language in the conventional sense but about a mode of being and teaching which allows people to understand each other in the esoteric sense. This involves a group automatically acting as a unit since the same meanings and the same purposes are evident to all. At a certain level, one cannot both understand and disagree, nor can one act in contradiction with one's understanding.

In the outer circle of humanity, which [[Ouspensky]] incidentally calls the circle of the confusion of tongues, precise understanding between any two people in any matter of relevance is virtually nonexistent. Only when approaching objective reason through esoteric work does man approach meaningful shared understanding.

The Genesis passage is a sort of left-hand path compliment to the power of precise shared understanding. The control system saw this as such a danger that it was worth destroying.

The following verse from Genesis further confirms that we are not speaking of language in the ordinary sense here:

**10:5** By these were the isles of the Gentiles divided in their lands; every one after his tongue, after their families, in their nations.

This clearly implies that prior to the tower episode various languages were spoken on Earth and that this was an entirely normal state of matters.

The Cassiopaea material states that building the tower was an effort at spiritual unification of the masses. This was to be accomplished by the use of a crystal. The control system, i.e. lizards destroyed this by brainwashing the public.

We note that in the Old Testament text, the God in question does not even claim to be anything but a prison guard of humanity.
