In the [[Cassiopaeans|Cassiopaean]] material, this refers to an [[Archetype|archetypal]] idea. This concept is related to that of a Platonic ideal form of something, existing outside of space and time.

The ray of creation starts with a division into two distinct thought centers, these being of [[Being vs. non-being|'being' and 'non-being']], also known as service to others/radiance/expansion and service to self/absorption/contraction. The term used will depend on the context and on what aspect of this fundamental duality one is discussing.

These thought centers then divide and branch into all conceivable variations of these themes. A thought center is not limited to any particular [[Density|density]]. They can be thought of as orthogonal to density, with the essential idea of the thought center finding a density specific manifestation at each level.

For example, a subdivision of the thought center of non-being can manifest in [[Second density|second density]] as the crocodile species, in [[Third density|third density]] as a certain type of [[psychopath]] and in [[Fourth density|fourth density]] as the 'lizzie.' The invariant idea here is a form of predation.

An individual can be seen as a crossroads of thought centers. The individual's [[Free will|free will]] consists in selecting alignment to one thought center or another. Thought centers interact with creation by being expressed by beings.

The concept is closely related to the [[Sufism|Sufi]] idea of the '[names of God]([[Names of God]]).' The [[Ra]] material also discusses the theme under the name 'distortion of the Law of One.'
