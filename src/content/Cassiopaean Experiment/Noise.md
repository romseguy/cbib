Noise as used by the [[FOTCM|FOTCM]] refers to any information which is irrelevant to a discussion, does not contribute meaningfully; detracts from the topic and/or confuses the issue.

Noise can be thrown into a discussion in numerous ways such as derailing the main topic by introducing side issues or counter arguments that cloud rather than clarify; keeping the discussion at a superficial level using only black or white contrasts - refusing to see the gray areas.
