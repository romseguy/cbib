In the [[Cassiopaeans|Cassiopaean]] material, **fourth density bleedthrough** refers to various anomalous perceptions and effects. The idea is that at certain times and places, the boundary between the [[Third density|third]] and [[Fourth density|fourth]] [[Density|densities]] becomes thinner and perceptions and laws of nature become somewhat fluid.

Examples of this are anomalous body sensations such as heat which does not register with a thermometer, experiences of seeing things from all angles at the same time, seeing multiple realities fading in and out of each other and so forth. Repeated fourth density activity in a specific locality of third density may cause increased bleedthrough. The Cassiopaeans say this sometimes occurs with underground bases manned by fourth density beings, such as the ones in New Mexico. These may also occur as side effects of channeling, [[Alien abduction|abduction by fourth density service to self beings]] and many other things.

As [[P. D. Ouspensky]] says, a miracle is not the cessation of laws of nature but the manifestation of a law of a higher level at a lower one. If [[God]] casually reversed laws of nature, then there would be little point in creation of these laws to start with. This does not, however. mean that in some cases laws of a higher world could not appear in a lower one.
