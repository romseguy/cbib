The term **realm of the three** is best explained with the following quote from the [[Cassiopaeans|Cassiopaean]] transcripts:

> **A:** Laura, my dear, if you really want to reveal "many beautiful and amazing things," all you need to do is remember the triad, the trilogy, the trinity, and look always for the triplicative connecting clue profile. Connect the threes... do not rest until you have found three beautifully balancing meanings!!

> **Q:** So, in everything there are three aspects?
> 
> **A:** And why? Because it is the realm of the three that you occupy. In order to possess the keys to the next level, just master the Third Man Theme, then move on with grace and anticipation.

This seems to say that things occur naturally in threes, due to a fundamental feature of this world and of the archetypal world of which this world is a reflection.

This could be a reference to the [[Fourth Way]] [[Law of Three]], which states that any phenomenon at any scale is always a confluence of three distinct forces. Mastering the third man theme may refer to the work needed for overcoming what [[Boris Mouravieff]] calls man's "third force blindness", i.e. tendency to think in either/or or black and white and to miss a deeper level reconciling these.
