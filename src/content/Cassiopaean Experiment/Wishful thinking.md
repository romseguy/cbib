According to the Cassiopaeans, **wishful thinking** is a fundamental property of the [[Service to others and service to self|service to self orientation]].

The core idea of "wishful thinking" is that one values one's personal [[Subjectivity|subjective]] preference over [[Knowledge|knowledge]] of the [[Objectivity|objective]] state of matters. This is a statement to the universe to the effect that the being does not wish to exist in said universe because the being's fantasies are preferred. This then ties with the idea of the thought center of [[Being vs. non-being|non-being]] and separation of self from all which is.

In the [[Third density|third density]], wishful thinking does not physically bend reality, it only hampers perception. According to the [[Cassiopaeans]], the case is different in the [[Fourth density|fourth density]], in which wishful thinking has the effect of quite concretely forming a sort of reality bubble. In densities beyond the fourth, beings cannot exist in pure service to self, presumably because the increased freedom of these densities would make it so the entity simply collapsed on itself and ceased interacting â€“ either living fully in a solipsistic bubble, or collapsing into inanimate matter.
