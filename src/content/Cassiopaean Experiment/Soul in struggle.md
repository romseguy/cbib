When discussing the issue of "organic portals" or "preadamic man", we are often confronted with the problem of discerning the difference between the absence of the so-called higher centers or individuated soul as opposed to the effects of psychological trauma.

A "soul in struggle" can look much the same as a person without individuated soul. We could say that a congenital psychopath is soul-less whereas a secondary sociopath may simply have adopted part of the opportunistic, deceitful, remorseless and self-serving, if also flaky ways of the psychopath as an adaptation to environment.

Specially with children, being initially more open or sensitive may increase the child's susceptibility to damage which may in later life manifest as personality disorders. Given the same circumstance, a souled individual may in cases become more damaged than a pre-Adamic one. Thus the extent of acting out or psychological disorder cannot be taken as a reliable indicator of being individually souled or not.
