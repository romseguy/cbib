Ever since the 1970's and possibly earlier, crops have been flattened on fields, forming more or less complex geometrical patterns called **crop circles**.

The phenomenon was dubbed a hoax, but even after some would-be hoaxers admitted to it, the phenomenon continued. A simple hoax perpetrated with ropes and planks is not a satisfactory solution to the widespread and sudden appearance of crop circles on consecutive years. Also, the circles incorporate recognizable geometric ideas which would be outside the range of sophistication of the self-admitted hoaxers.

The [[Cassiopaeans]] have said that the circles, with the exception of a very few hoaxes, represent thoughts of [[Sixth density|sixth density]], i.e. are genuine communications of "higher beings". In some instances, secret government entities may have made crop circles with their own technology to further confuse the issue.

There is no generally known or unambiguous interpretation of the possible messages in the crop circles. The ambiguous and non-permanent nature of crop circles is consistent with the principle of preserving [[Free will|free will]] by higher positive forces. Communications must not constitute incontrovertible proof and must be open to interpretation.

Extensive information including pictures is to be found on the Internet.
