"**Spinning**" is a moving meditation involving spinning around one's vertical axis, with arms outstretched.

This is mostly a [[Sufism|Sufi]] practice, although this is also found elsewhere. The [[Cassiopaeans]] and [[Pleiadians]] recommend spinning as a spiritually useful activity. The direction, speed, count of revolutions and specifics of hand posture etc. vary depending on source.
