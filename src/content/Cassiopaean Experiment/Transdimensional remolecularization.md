**Transdimensional remolecularization** is a Cassiopaea term for a process of transferring entities between [[Density|densities]] or effecting teleportation. We do not have any formal understanding of what such a process would entail in terms of technology. Such a process is said to take place in most [[Alien abduction|alien abductions]].

The process is described approximately as follows:

The [[Soul|soul]] is extracted from the body and used as a template for constructing a [[Fourth density|fourth density]] body. This body is then manipulated, after which the process is reversed, transferring the manipulations to the [[Third density|third density]] body.

Time in fourth density where the abductee is taken is not bound to the flow of time in the third density native to the abductee. The soul is generally returned to the body at the time of the original extraction, but sometimes the abductors are "sloppy". If the soul is returned to a time preceding the extraction, it may cause perceptual anomalies of the sort sometimes associated with [[UFO phenomenon|UFO experiences]], or potentially mental issues if the time difference is great. If the soul is returned to a later time, the result will be an experience of "missing time".

The idea is generally consistent with what is reported about UFO interactions and is compatible with the general absence of physical evidence and the [[High strangeness|high strangeness]] of these accounts.

We can speculate that the form-giving or [[etheric body]] of a being is some sort of information field which interacts with some physical phenomenon such as a specially modulated EM field. Such an interaction could be used to capture such a pattern and use it for constructing a material form in some other point of space-time, possibly out of different materials of a different "density". Phenomena such a Kirlian photography or the phantom DNA effect suggest the existence of such a thing but interacting with it is speculative. Furthermore, such a pattern is not the same as soul.

The [[Cassiopaeans]] have suggested that neutrinos mediate between soul and [[Memory|memory]], thus these also would be involved. Again, this is next to untestable since neutrinos hardly interact with anything known to physics.
