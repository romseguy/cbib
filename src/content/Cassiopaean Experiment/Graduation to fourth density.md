Much of the inspiration of the work of the [[FOTCM]] has to do with the concept of a planetary change called [[The Wave|the Wave]] by the [[Cassiopaeans]]. Even though we do not from the present perspective know exactly how such a transition would work nor what the end state of such would be, people often ask about this matter. We will here combine material from channeled sources and tradition reviewed by the FOTCM in an attempt to shed light on this. We recognize that we cannot speak on this with certainty or authority and are bound to be only fragmentary and partial in what understanding we may have.

There appears to be a certain benchmark that a being must meet in order to pass from [[Third density|third density]] incarnations to [[Fourth density|fourth density]] ones. Additionally, it seems that in some cases this can take place while in the body. This benchmark is variously described but all descriptions raise more questions than they answer. We will look at diverse aspects mentioned by different sources below.

[[Ra]] says that one must be either over 50% [service to others]([[Service to others and service to self]]) or over 95% [[Service to others and service to self|service to self]] in orientation to qualify. These are equally difficult for the human, which by nature fluctuates somewhere in-between. Fluctuating in-between only qualifies one for more of the same, in the hope that enough experience eventually drive one to choose either polarity.

The Cassiopaeans emphasize simply learning the [[Lessons|lessons]] of one's [[Density|density]] – i.e. third density – acquiring basic understandings and dealing with [karma]([[Karma]]). Learning the lessons involve becoming practically proficient at seeing the world and navigating in it while not becoming caught in its ways. The Sufis say 'to be in the world but not of it.'

Separating emotions which open one up to possibilities from those which limit is a lesson to be learned and practiced. A certain quality of emotional structure is important.

Mastery of [[little 'I's]] is practically necessary because the 50% STO or 95% STS-ness is hardly possible without great internal and external consistency. One must have [[Being|being]] and capacity for [doing]([[Doing]]) to manifest these.

[[Seeing the unseen]] means, among other things, discerning the often subtle difference between STS and STO in practical life. Without this [[Discernment|discernment]] of the invisible, consistently choosing one over the other is hardly possible. This is a skill and practice is necessary.

[[Boris Mouravieff]] and [[P. D. Ouspensky]] speak of the possibility of attaining all the development possible in the human form. This is the end of the [[Fourth Way]], when one has become 'man number 7,' in possession of a [permanent individuality]([[Real I]]) and voluntary access to all states of [[Consciousness|consciousness]] humanly possible. Such attainment is virtually unknown in history and even recognizing such would be problematic. The legendary [[Fulcanelli]] may have attained something of the sort but then we do not have a biography to study. In terms of historical figures, Ra names Genghis Khan and St Francis of Assisi as mid-term graduates for STS and STO respectively. We get the idea that such attainment is extremely rare.

Many speak of a balance of [[Centers (Fourth Way)|centers]] or functions as a necessary condition for graduation. We could say that the lessons are learned only when they form a balance that is not overly weighted on one side nor is anything skipped. Ra speaks of the balance and intensity of the rays or chakras. STO is balanced but STS graduates by a sort of omission, by skipping the heart chakra or higher emotional center and directly going to the higher intellectual functions for accessing 'magical' powers. The Fourth Way says the same in different words, after all even the name of [[George Gurdjieff]]'s institute was the Institute for the Harmonious Development of Man. The lower centers must be balanced and brought under the control of the [[Magnetic center|magnetic center]], which fuses with the [[Higher centers|higher emotional center]] and finally opens the [higher intellectual center]([[Higher centers]]). Opening the higher intellectual center by other means is black magic and opposed to the Fourth Way.

The relationship of harvestability with unusual psychic powers is unclear. Mouravieff writes that such powers may manifest insofar the specific service of the individual so requires, to each in a different way but that they are in no way an end in themselves. The one power which is essential is the instinctive recognition between [[Truth|truth]] and [falsehood]([[Lies and lying]]), which forms as one gains access to the higher emotional center. Ra says that opening the 'gateway to intelligent infinity' is a criterion, which pretty much amounts to the Fourth Way idea of accessing the higher intellectual center. This in turn has to do with a specific psychic metabolism of 'higher [[Hydrogens (Fourth Way)|hydrogens]].'

There is much talk in the [[New Age]] market about physical effects and substances and practices for speeding up one's ascension. The 'enlightening virtues' of [monoatomic gold]([[Monoatomic gold]]) are a case in point. We see all such techniques as sidestepping the basic issue of learning and applying lessons and manifesting one's individual gifts on the side of creation, whichever these may be.

[[DNA changes]] are mentioned by the Cassiopaeans as being part of a transition to fourth density. This would at least suggest that some DNA features have to do with the possibility. This is hardly surprising since heredity determines human capacities in general. The Cassiopaeans note that '[[Soul|soul]] marries systematic construct when present,' in relation to the DNA and the soul having to be compatible for incarnation to take place.

The graduation is generally depicted as having to do with large scale external events, not only one's internal state. The Cassiopaeans suggest that light from a past [[White dwarves and supernovae|supernova]] would reach the Earth around the time of the transition, which would accelerate the progress of those with a sufficient degree of internal polarization. Also, the Wave is described as a specific discrete event facilitating the passage. Ra and Cassiopaeans thus indirectly suggest that the near-absence of mid-term graduations cannot be directly extrapolated for estimating the size of the harvest. There are no estimates but all sources agree that the numbers are very small in relation to the size of the population.

Ra describes the matching of a soul to a density as consisting of a walk towards an increasing brightness of light. The soul stops at the point where the light is too intense. There are discrete steps corresponding to the boundary between densities.

We get the idea that for an individual to make the grade based on one's own efforts is vanishingly rare, whether in the world or in a monastic setting. Effects and experiences may manifest but this does not yet make the difference. For the STS adept, working alone is in practice the only way since such a being only seeks to control and not to share. For STO, working in a group is natural. After all, one cannot serve others without having similarly oriented others. (Serving STS-oriented beings, or serving the STS-ness in persons of mixed character only contributes to the principle of STS.) Thus, there is great help to be received by balanced or STO exchange. The exchange may compensate for individual shortcomings, producing a group entity that meets the criteria even though not all individuals alone would. The FOTCM is experimenting with the idea that the group collectively may have close to the capacities of a single fourth density STO being.

There is no free ride, however, since natural factors make it so that effective membership only exists when there is reciprocal exchange of a requisite metaphysical quality. What this is will depend on specifics and we cannot draw a checklist. This idea corresponds to the Christian idea of the congregation being the body of Christ. Where the head goes goes the body also. What is gained or lost by one is gained or lost by all, says Gurdjieff with reference to groups.

From Ra:

> 'The best way of service to others is the constant attempt to seek to share the love of the Creator as it is known to the inner self. This involves self knowledge and the ability to open the self to the other-self without hesitation. This involves, shall we say, radiating that which is the essence or the heart of the mind/body/ spirit complex. Speaking to the intention of your question, the best way for each seeker in third density to be of service to others is unique to that mind/body/spirit complex. This means that the mind/body/ spirit complex must then seek within itself the intelligence of its own discernment as to the way it may best serve other-selves. This will be different for each.'\[End quote\]

From the Cassiopaeans:

> _\[…\] What do you think? Remember, you learn on an exponential curve, once you have become "tuned in." This means that you become increasingly able to access the universal consciousness. Please learn to trust your increasing awareness. All who are present here are at one point or another on that cycle, or one point or another on that cycle of progression, some further along than others. If you properly network without prejudice, you may all wind up at the same point on this cycle. We also mean that you can access the universal consciousness to find the answers to otherwise unseen truths \[…\]._

> Life is religion. Life experiences reflect how one interacts with God. Those who are asleep are those of little faith in terms of their interaction with the creation. Some people think that the world exists for them to overcome or ignore or shut out. For those individuals, the worlds will cease. They will become exactly what they give to life. They will become merely a dream in the 'past.' People who pay strict attention to objective reality right and left, become the reality of the 'Future.'

The above summary is of necessity very partial. To get a better idea on this, the reader is advised to read:

*   _[[The Wave Series]]_
*   [[Cassiopaean session transcripts]] (It is recommended that _The Wave Series_, which presents much of the Cassiopaean session transcripts in context, be read in its entirety first.)
*   _The Law of One_
*   Boris Mouravieff's _[[Gnosis]]_ trilogy
*   [[Fulcanelli]]'s works

And along with the above books, also to read other literature referenced herein.
