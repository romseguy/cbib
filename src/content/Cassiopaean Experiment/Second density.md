In the scale of [[Density|densities]], the **second density** corresponds to everything that grows biologically, up to the point where the emphasis in evolution shifts from the biological evolution of a species to the mental and spiritual evolution of distinct individuals.

The second density begins with the advent of self-replicating organisms subject to a biological evolution. The line between second and [[Third density|third density]] is hard to draw with exactitude but would generally correspond to the separation of modern type humans from primates.

Learning takes place in all densities and in the second density it primarily takes place at the level of a species adapting to an ecological situation or niche. Still. Second density cannot be seen in Darwinian terms only. It is noteworthy that the dividing lines between species are well defined, displaying distinct jumps and sudden species formation rather than smooth transition.

Esoteric culture speaks of the existence of species oversouls, which would be the non-physical counterpart of an animal species. The physical representation of this oversoul would be the DNA defining the species and its learning would physically be represented as the biological evolution of this DNA. At the non-physical level, the species oversoul, the effective unit of evolution, undergoes learning through the collective sum of all its incarnations in all the individuals of the species.

As the learning capacity of individual members of the species increases, as with higher animals, the emphasis of learning may shift from the genetically transmitted learning of the whole species to what is learned by an individual member of the species and stored in its [[Brain|brain]] or "soul imprint". Thus the "soul imprint" may become no longer soluble or assimilable into the anonymous soul pool of the species.

Thus individual fragments of the species oversoul may become self-conscious and harvest-able to third density.

The notion of the [[Organic portal|organic portal]] further complicates the transition between second and third densities. Also, the emergence of individuated [[Soul|soul]] cannot be seen in terms of reflexive self-awareness, cognitive or behavioral learning alone. See the two quotes below.

From [[Ra]]:

**QUESTIONER:** Let's take the point at which an individualized entity of second density is ready for transition to third. Is this second-density being what we would call animal?

**RA:** I am Ra. There are three types of second-density entities which become, shall we say, enspirited. The first is the animal. This is the most predominant. The second is the vegetable, most especially that which you call, sound vibration complex, "tree." These entities are capable of giving and receiving enough love to become individualized. The third is mineral. Occasionally a certain location/place, as you may call it, becomes energized to individuality through the love it receives and gives in relationship to a third-density entity which is in relationship to it. This is the least common transition.

**QUESTIONER:** When this transition from second to third density takes place, how does the entity, whether it be animal, \[vegetable\] tree, or mineral, become enspirited?

**RA:** I am Ra. Entities do not become enspirited. They become aware of the intelligent energy within each portion, cell, or atom, as you may call it, of its beingness. This awareness is that which is awareness of that already given. From the infinite come all densities. The self-awareness comes from within given the catalyst of certain experiences understanding, as we may call this particular energy, the upward spiralling of the cell or atom or consciousness. You may then see that there is an inevitable pull toward the, what you may call, eventual realization of self.

From the [[Cassiopaeans|Cassiopaean]] material:

> **A:**...beware: 3rd density STS orientation includes the thought of "dominion" over 2nd density, and this is merely a continuation of the energy buildups of the approach of the wave... Some of the lessons are interesting indeed. When you assume that capture and imprisonment of those of lesser capacity than you is for "the good," why should not you expect those of greater capacity than you to assume the same regarding you?!?

> **A:** What if: one on 2nd density perceives objects due to their similarity. One on 3rd density perceives objects due to their difference, and one on 4th density perceives objects in terms of their own union with all of them?

> **Q:** (L) Is there some way to communicate with whales or dolphins and can one find a way to translate the differences and have a reasonable, intelligent exchange with a whale or a dolphin or even an elephant?
> 
> **A:** You don't need conversation "with" when a higher telepathic level.

> **Q:** (L) Dolphins and whales communicate telepathically?
> 
> **A:** Yes. So do dogs and cats and snakes etc. etc. only humans have learned the "superior" art of verbal communication.

In the [[Fourth Way]] terminology, "one and two brained being" constitute second density. The "brains" in question are also known as [[moving center]] and [[emotional center]]. All living things have a moving center adapted to the species which regulates its physical processes, whatever these may be. Higher animals further have an emotional center. Both these centers have intelligence in their specific domains, but still do not grant capacity for abstract thought. That is the hallmark of "three-brained beings" who in addition have an [[intellectual center]], in Gurdjieff's system of terminology, and which correspond to third density and higher beings.
