According to the Cassiopaeans, smoking tobacco may be beneficial to psychic perception and can stimulate brain activity.

There are clinical studies which find that nicotine can combat the effects of Altzheimer's disease and have other beneficial effects.

There appears to be a worldwide crusade against smoking that is quite out of proportion with the alleged ill effects of smoking. It is specially hypocritical that governments simultaneously nearly outlaw smoking due to alleged health hazards and simultaneously display no interest whatsoever in preserving the environment. We may therefore infer that there must exist a covert reason.
