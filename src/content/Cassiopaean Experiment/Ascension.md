In [[FOTCM|FOTCM]] parlance, **ascension** refers to completing the development possible for and cosmically required of the human form and consequently moving to a qualitatively different form of being.

Close synonyms are "[graduating to fourth density]([[Graduation to fourth density]])", or accomplishing the Great Work of the [alchemist]([[Alchemy]]). In [[Fourth Way]] terms, when man has evolved to man 7 and acquired an "immortal" [astral body]([[Bodies of man]]), such a transformation may in principle be possible after [[Death|death]].
