According to the Cassiopaea material, there was a fifth planet of the solar system where now the asteroid belt between the orbits of Mars and Jupiter is found. The planet was destroyed about 80,000 years ago and a large human population was transferred from there to Earth on the occasion. This population carried the tall, blond, blue eyed genes often found among Northern populations. Aryans and Celts are branches of this original population. The population originally spread from the area of the Caucasus.

The term "Aryan" has been variously used to designate race or tribal unit within the general race.
