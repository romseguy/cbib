This page is a **guide to [[Éiriú Eolas]]** for those who don’t have the time to dig through the 100+ pages of the big [Cassiopaea Forum EE thread](https://cassiopaea.org/forum/index.php?topic=12837.0). There is a lot of valuable information scattered throughout that thread, and the point of this guide is to show you the usual effects of EE practice and to present the valuable advice for practicing EE that has been given, in a simple and effective way.

This is an informal guide, assembled from questions and replies by many people. (Large portions of the text comes from posts by [[Laura Knight-Jadczyk]].) It is based on the Éiriú Eolas [Guide/FAQ Cassiopaea Forum thread](https://cassiopaea.org/forum/index.php/topic,14410.0.html). A much shorter, official quick guide can be found on the [Éiriú Eolas website](https://eiriu-eolas.org/documents/Eiriu%20Eolas%20Quick%20Guide.pdf) (PDF).

Introduction
------------

If you have no experience with meditation or anything associated with it, it’s best for you to first practice with exercising your diaphragm and practicing pipe breathing, and then add more to the program as you feel comfortable, and **what everyone needs to keep in mind is that you breath in through the nose and out through the mouth, this applies to the whole program!**

Another note that I want too give is that everyone who is doing the EE breathing program and is feeling like they can't take it anymore, I suggest that those of you who feel like that to drop the round breathing and do the meditation/prayer only, after things cool down within you, you can slowly reintroduce the round breathing and when slowly re-introducing the round breathing, it might be appropriate to just do a single 'set' (I mean a single whole cycle, ie: slow then medium then fast), to start with, rather than the full three sets, to see how it goes.

Also another important note:

**The bio-energetic breathing is NOT recommended for individuals who may have bi-polar disorder or possibly even other brain chemistry imbalances. If you are having really "out there" experiences, then do NOT do the round breathing, stick with pipe breathing and the meditation.**

I also recommend all of you to continue posting your experiences and questions in the Éiriú-Eolas breathing program thread.

This guide will be fine-tuned and updated every time.

Remember that every individual responds differently to the EE program, these symptoms have so far been reported and will be updated as we get new data.

Questions and Answers
---------------------

### I can’t keep up with the counting, help!

If the count is too long or too short for you, adjust it to what is comfortable.

### Do I breathe in for the full counts?

Breathe in for the full count, yes. And try to breathe in as deeply as possible, with the diaphragm, so that when I say "hold" you have really full lungs and can then, following the hold, control the slow release of the breath to emphasize the period of vagal nerve stimulation. The short hold after the release of the breath will make you "air hungry" so that you will be more inclined to breathe as deeply as possible when I next say "breathe in.

### I am yawning a lot, why?

> It happens when one functions from 'intellectual' part of centers rather than 'mechanical' or 'emotional' part of centers, which means using 'controlled' attention. You can observe it in any practices/exercises that require 'controlled' attention. And interestingly enough if you continue more after 'yawning' is observed, you will reach the point where suddenly 'fresh' energy will be supplied.

More about yawning can be found in [this forum post](https://cassiopaea.org/forum/index.php?topic=6695.msg46332#msg46332).

### Can I lay down?

I've always meditated while lying down with excellent results.

### Am I doing the pipe breath wrong?

_"Perhaps I'm not getting the pipe breathing aspect of it down properly. When I make the 'Haaa' noise it seems to me like it prevents me from keeping the pharyngeal passage constricted. The only constriction I've been able to achieve that produces a similar sound to the audio file is holding my throat as if I were about to make a "k" sound. If I then make the 'haa' noise it opens up this constriction immediately. Is this the wrong area to be constricting?"_

Yes, I think the area of the throat that is "flexed" when you are making a "k" sound is not the area where the vagus nerve is located. At least when I just did it, it was using a different area than I used when doing the 'haaaa' sound. Of course I may be off or you could be having different results making the 'k' sound.

If you've ever had glasses, the exhale part of the exercise is roughly the same as when you are going to gently breath onto your lenses before cleaning them with a tissue. You just have to breath out with a bit more force. The same 'haaa' noise is produced, and for me at least, the same area of the throat is flexed. Maybe try doing the breathing with that in mind and see if it doesn't help.

### My tongue is getting in the way

_"What happens to your tongue when you are doing the breathing? Mine has a tendency to kind of "fall in" when relaxed, obstructing the throat and interfering with the "pipe" set-up necessary for this exercise. Does anyone else have the same problem? What's the best way to deal with it?"_

It might help to try to keep the tip of your tongue gently touching the palate, neither too far back nor too far forward. There is more information on tongue position in [this forum post](https://cassiopaea.org/forum/index.php/topic,2989.msg378649.html#msg378649).

### I can’t keep my arms up, and what is this tingling?

Those who have problems holding their arms up, just do it as much as you can and then put them down and finish that way. Over time, I believe your strength/energy will increase. Lying down to practice belly breathing is also a good idea. It might also be possible for those who have limited energy to do the three stage breathing lying down also!

As for tingling, that is not unusual for some. If the pace is too fast and induces these effects and you are not comfortable with them, then slow down. Go at your own pace, be gentle with yourself! Rome wasn't built in a day and you didn't get all those layers of armoring overnight. In some cases, you didn't even get it in just one life, either!

### The bio-energetic breathing part is so long!

I know that the bio-energetic breathing segment seems long, but it is intended that way. If you just push through and stay with it as best you can, you will see amazing results after a few sessions. It will get even better when the process is memorized both in your moving center and your mind. At that point, your body will take over the breathing, the mind will take over concentrating on the meaning of the words, and that will allow the heart to open and release its burden of pain, grief, karma, and so on. When that happens, believe me, you will know it! It may not even happen during the exercise/meditation– it may happen hours later, or days later. But when the lower emotional center connects with the higher emotional center, you will be amazed...

Each of you will need to figure out your own frequency. At first, you may want to do the Beatha/meditation every day for a week or so. Then, every couple of days, or just when you are particularly stressed. Maybe after awhile, only once a week. But you will certainly want to try to do the Pipe breathing as often as you need to, at least once a day, to keep that Vagus Nerve in good working order!

### All this crying and anger, is this normal?

Crying or feeling angry or other emotions during the breathing is quite normal. Keep a pillow nearby to punch if you feel like it!

Remember, you are processing – metabolizing – old, stuffed emotions that you need to get out. Sometimes it takes awhile.

### When you start to cry, how do you go on breathing?

_"Regarding the crying; How do I continue to breath when I start to cry, my normal reflex is to hold the breath, but I remembered to keep on breathing as good as possible. How do you go on breathing?"_

Why don’t you just let it be, tears are pure cleansing water. You can cry as much as you can and start breathing when you are ready....

### I think I understand how it should feel on the exhale but how should it feel on the inhale?

_"I have a question about the pipe breathing, I think I understand how it should feel on the exhale but how should it feel on the inhale? Like the way I'm doing it now is in through the nose and trying to do the constriction so it feels like the air is running down the back of my throat . If that's clear enough. Like if I try to over do it I'll start making whistling noises with the back of my throat. Is that right? Then on the exhale the air passes up the back of my throat and mostly running across the top palette of my mouth with the haaaaa sound."_

For me, one of the most striking features of it is that there is almost no sense that the air is flowing in through either the mouth or the nose. The draw on the air is created by the contraction of the muscles at the back of the throat. When you deliberately breath through your nose your nostrils flare a little and you feel the air passing in. When you breath deliberately through your mouth you feel the air on your teeth and tongue. But with pipe breathing the sensations are absent. Like I sad, it's almost like the air is being pulled by the muscles at the back of the mouth and throat, so maybe it is the air that is already in the mouth and nasal passages that is being inhaled.

### At some point I snap into a dream state where I don't hear the audio, then realize I'm dreaming and snap out again. What's going on?

This is normal and a good sign that something is happening. I call it "zoning". I don't know where you go or what you are doing, but generally, after it happens for awhile, you start to get some other action going in the emotions department.

And just so ya'll know, when the emotional center does finally start opening and letting stuff go, you will KNOW it. There will be no mistaking it. You won't be writing saying "oh, I had this funny thing or that funny thing happen... was that it?" No, indeed... you will feel like you are in the middle of an emotional hurricane and need to tie yourself to a tree to remain standing. You may feel like your solar plexus has opened a hole the size of a dinner plate and the winds of the universe and time are blowing through you.

IF this happens to you, the important thing to do is to just keep saying to yourself "This will pass, let me just feel everything..."

And feel everything you WILL!

This is essential. Remember what the Cs said about The Wave?

> Cassiopaean session 3 Dec 94:
> 
> Q: (L) What does this wave consist of in terms of energy?
> 
> A: Feeling.
> 
> Q: (L) This wave is feeling? It is a wave of emotion?
> 
> A: Hyperkinetic sensate.
> 
> Q: (L) What does that mean?
> 
> A: All.

Keep in mind that you are clearing this stuff in advance so that when the Wave comes, it won't kill you.

### I have very scary dreams when doing the program, why?

It is the emotional center that dreams. During this process, when you have unpleasant or scary dreams, it is all the negative emotions you have suppressed starting to come to the surface. Quite often you can process this stuff just by dreaming it away. But, the stirring of the emotional center can also lead to a healthy eruption and catharsis. It's hard to say – everyone is different and has different stuff buried inside.

### I did the meditation and prayer before falling asleep and what I remember is that I heard the same kind of conversation all night

_"After my daughter went to sleep, I went to bed and started doing the meditation and prayer of the soul for maybe 12 to 15 time before falling asleep and what I remember is that I eared the same kind of conversation all night. (I woke up 3 times during the night and every time I was aware of the conversation before full consciousness.) I don't know if this as anything to do whit becoming more aware of ours self or if it is just the subconscious releasing negative emotion but I am curious to know if anyone as similar experience."_

That's really interesting. I used to have those split realities a lot myself! It's definitely another of the signs that stuff is happening. After a lot of those experiences, I figured I was experiencing bleed-throughs of other lives and sorting things out. I also thought that maybe some part of myself was actually having conversations with other parts of myself, or with other individuals in other realities.

Another weird experience that sort of went along with that was being able to see with my eyes closed.

### During the Warrior's breath my nose became dry and sensitive, any advice?

_"I noticed that after the warriors breath and during some of the Ba-Ha, the nostrils got very dry and became sensitive so that I couldn't take in as much air on the inhale as I wanted to. Any advice?"_

You may want to try concentrating your inhalation from the throat & diaphragm rather than the nostril. It allows for much smoother and deeper inhalation in my experience. In other words, when breathing in through the nose, draw the breath in from the throat and diaphragm letting the air gently come through the nostrils into the nose but the emphasis of the inhalation comes from throat and diaphram.

### Can three-stage breathing be done without the arm positions?

The 3 arm positions allow you to focus on fully breathing, and progressively using the whole of the lungs:

1.  With the diaphragm, which many people don't use fully as a matter of course, and is something that is always focussed on in exercises to do with breathing 'properly',
2.  Extending up into the chest area, and
3.  Fully extending the chest, so as to fill right up to the top of the lungs.

So the arm positions are a useful reminder, and help focus the mind on the correct parts of the body, and feel the expansion, and especially when raising the arms and putting hands on the back of the shoulders really helps to stretch the body, to maximize air intake.

### When sitting cross-legged, my legs fall asleep and start bothering me, any advice?

_"I've mainly had issues with sitting cross-legged for so long. My legs fall asleep and start bothering me. Pffff any advice?"_

Geeze, sit in a chair. Be comfortable. The girls in the video are doing yoga and stuff and they sometimes do the program in a chair or lying down! I ALWAYS do it in a chair! With my knees?

### Is it okay for my children to join in with the program?

I think that it is fine for children to join in though at their own pace, in their own way and only if they want to. If they don't do the practice exactly right, that's okay – let them do it as a form of play. Listening to the prayer as they go to sleep would also be beneficial and protective, I think.

### Is it "normal" to "see" (eyes closed) light flashes during the meditation?

One thing about "light": If you start seeing lights, it might be helpful to sort of "grab" them (or it) with your mind and try to hold it still. Over time, you may be able to do this, and then, watch it and "grow" it.

### Why am I zoning out? Is it because I lack energy or something?

The C's seem to say its a form of communication with our higher selves. Quote from Cassiopaean session:

> A: Humans should remember the hermetic maxim can go both ways in some respects. Those who are destined to "meet" themselves in the future can now do so with greater facility due to these efforts. We once said that "you in the future" could "rewrite" cosmic programs... that goes for others too. They are now learning the programming language.
> 
> Q: (L) A number of people on the forum have talked about the zoning out thing, the, ya know... while still awake seemingly, losing all awareness of self and just kind of zoning out. What is this phenomenon?
> 
> A: See previous answer and think of it as spending "time" with the higher self/teacher instead of wasting the ability to dissociate on futile illusions. Also remember that "time" spent in this process utilizes this "soul ability" as it was originally intended. It taxes the soul greatly to be embodied.

And we also have this from _[[In Search of the Miraculous]]_:

> The fourth state of consciousness is called the objective state of consciousness In this state a man can see things as they are. Flashes of this state of consciousness also occur in man. In the religions of all nations there are indications of the possibility of a state of consciousness of this kind which is called 'enlightenment' and various other names but which cannot be described in words. But the only right way to objective consciousness is through the development of self-consciousness. If an ordinary man is artificially brought into a state of objective consciousness and afterwards brought back to his usual state he will remember nothing and he will think that for a time he had lost consciousness. But in the state of self-consciousness a man can have Hashes of objective consciousness and remember them.
> 
> – Page 149

> In most cases where accidental contact with the higher thinking center takes place a man becomes unconscious. The mind refuses to take in the flood of thoughts, emotions, images, and ideas which suddenly burst into it. And instead of a vivid thought, or a vivid emotion, there results, on the contrary, a complete blank, a state of unconsciousness.

### What about this pressure I feel on my forehead, around the "third eye"?

If you feel a "heaviness" around the third eye, also try to "hold it" and see if it is not "light trying to break through." These are just suggestions, not hard and fast rules.

### Is our higher self composed of two or more people? Is this what is meant by "soul groups"?

No, your higher self is not composed of "two or more people" though there can be different aspects. You can feel like your higher/true self/essence is your TRUE Parent, male or female. It is also the essence of your true child. It is, in a sense, the trinity, but it is YOU.

### I got really sick yesterday, what is going on?

*   "_I got really sick yesterday – like a stomach flu complete with fever, chills and body aches. What's unusual is that what I ate the night before, I also had that same morning with no effects. The night that I went to sleep (just prior to getting sick the next morning) I had a really good breathing/meditation session. Initially when I woke up I felt mostly fine, but withing a half hour everything hit and was completely incapacitated. Is this one of the things that can happen as part of the cleansing?_"

*   _"Fwiw I've been having a few problems along those lines, The one thing I will say is that I do seem extremal tired (physically) from doing this the last few weeks. I wonder if part of me (that blocks my emotions) is needing more energy to block?? Fighting myself perhaps..... After doing the full sessions at night I wake up rested (relaxed) but exhausted, if that's even possible."_

*   _"Since I started doing the breathing program in the evening I've also had mornings when I feel like a truck had drove over me, even though I slept pretty well."_

*   _"In the past few days I have developed quite some tension in my shoulders, and a general lack of interest in just about everything. What is going on??"_

Keep in mind that this breathing program ALSO detoxes physically, not just emotionally. When you kick-start the vagus nerve and start putting things back in motion, after years of the physical cesspool backing up, it can be like a hole in the dyke that gets big very fast!

So, for those of you having physical symptoms, it can very well be a detox reaction") and you may need to re-read some of the Diet and Health information and reconsider your diet/supplement options.

For those of you who have suffered from chronic fatigue or Fibromyalgia, we have just read a very interesting book: _[[Treating and Beating Fibromyalgia and Chronic Fatigue Syndrome]]_ by Rodger Murphree. Highly recommended as an adjunct text to Mark Hyman's _[[The UltraMind Solution]]_.

As a side note: the husband of an ill woman wrote to me recently describing all her symptoms of "attack" and "demonic infestation" and so on and so forth. It sounded to me like she was suffering from candidiasis and leaky gut leading to Chronic Fatigue. So, I wrote back with dietary and supplement suggestions which the man implemented for her right away. He just recently wrote again to say that all her "attack" symptoms have cleared up (including some poltergeist type stuff!) and they are very happy to know that it was NOT demons.

So, let's take care of the basics before we start assuming scary things about what goes on in our bodies and around us.

_ADDED:_ I want to also add that you should all remember what I wrote previously about pouring new wine into old bottles. The vessel needs to be prepared and purified. Toxins and other "invaders" in the physical system resonate to negative energies (not a surprise!) When you start pouring positive energies in, there will be a conflict if you have not previously done some serious physical detoxing work!!!

If you are taking "light baths" and the physical body is very "dirty" with toxicity, yeah, there is gonna be a reaction!

What actually takes place during the "light baths" is that the generating of this penetrating light cleanses away all that would make you unfit for the seating of the soul. This takes a varying time according to what your life (even past life) experiences have been. In some cases where purity of thought and action have prevailed this does not take long, in others the process is slower and more painful. But it is cumulative even if you do it more slowly and, as I already said, at some point, without warning, the opening of the "heart center" (the merging of the lower emotional center with the higher emotional center) will occur. That, in itself, is QUITE an experience! At that point, you will experience the timeless, limitless force of your true nature and you will know fully and completely what the inclination and purpose of your life. What is more, you will know how to implement it because the higher intellectual center will be accessible and the guidance of this timeless, limitless knowing will be available to you.

### I have not experienced any of the symptoms. Does this mean I'm an organic portal?

Well, first of all, we don't really know if any of the symptoms (physical or mental) are an indication that we have a [[soul]] or not. We don't know enough of the process to put such labels on our experiences. In fact, if we consider everything that has been posted on the forum about all kind of "personal phenomena" traps, we should be wary if we get any tangible results too quickly or if they sound too good to be true. Of course, those symptoms might be totally genuine, we just need to remember that it's a process that might manifest itself in different ways for different people, doesn't matter if they have a soul or not.

And coming back to the issue of being an [[organic portal]] or not, ask yourself why you are concerned with a possibility of being an OP? What's wrong with that? Does it mean that you are doomed? I don't think so. OPs or not, we all make our own choices, and the rest of it is just [[self-importance]].

### Is it more fruitful to do the meditation solo or with the audio? Does it matter?

I think it is helpful to do it both ways. If we assume it to be possible that there are frequencies being transmitted, then listening is helpful for that reason. But, in terms of learning to discipline the mind, meditating on your own, mastering the flow yourself, is also good practice.

Of course, in any situation where you need a fast calm down, or relief from some kind of trauma, the audio can be very helpful. And frankly, from what I've read on this forum, and from what I get in my email, there are a lot of people that need this program and fast!

### I haven't experienced what most people have. Did I miss something?

_"I have to ask since I have not really experienced the things most people did most often. Is there a possibility that I am blocking myself? Is there something I missed? Or is it just that we not always experience the same things well doing this when still doing it right?"_

Be patient! It was only after a couple of full months that I even had significant action. And remember, I wasn't EXPECTING anything! I was just doing it to help with my stress and also to learn to discipline my mind and control my thoughts. I had read about a guy who decided to learn to meditate in the middle of World War I") and he began his practice in a foxhole in a battlefield. He figured if he could meditate in the middle of bombs falling all around, he could do it anywhere. That inspired me because I had four little children at the time and a LOT of stress. So that was mainly my goal: to relieve stress and stop being so cranky with my children and husband.

Meditating is like lifting weights with your mind – it gets stronger cumulatively. Depending on what you start with, it can take more or less time to accumulate the "mental strength" to move over that "barrier."

So, be patient and concentrate on the meditation as often as you can do it. The three stage breathing is nice to do a couple times a week, and the pipe breathing at least once a day (maybe starting off your meditation), but the main thing is the meditation.

### Last week was very "easy", but now I feel exhausted and sad again. Is this part of the process?

_"Since last week was so “easy”, I thought I was on some kind of roll. HA! Now I am back to feeling exhausted and sad. All the [[little 'I's]] are piping up during the meditation – clearly uninterested in focusing – so while I think I am progressing, “they” apparently have other ideas. And then there are those increasing moments of seeing the dark parts of my personality that are so appalling. Makes me wonder if I am really up to this….or just an [[organic portal]] with ambitions. It’s soo demoralizing. After spending so many years searching for something REAL – I now find myself wondering if I really have the “right stuff”. I hope this is part of the process….arghhh!!!"_

Yup, all of that is the "[[predator's mind]]." The "oh, give up..." being whispered seductively in your ear...

Don't worry, been there, done that – more than once. Here's a clip from a session when I was there:

> Cassiopaean Session 15 April 1995
>

I wasn't contemplating suicide, I was just thinking how nice it would be if we could just turn out the lights and end the illusion. (T) Okay, so we have identified the two, you and Frank. (L) So, in other words Jan, it is going to get worse. {...}

Notice that this was after the cleansing event of the previous February. I'm tellin' ya, because of the situation (disintegrating marriage, responsibility for children, poor health, etc) I was in, it was one hell of a struggle to go on day after day.

But I managed to keep reading, to keep doing the sessions – my curiosity didn't go completely dormant – and that was like hanging on by a thread. Remember, also, Castaneda's take on it: that it requires discipline to force the "[[Predator’s mind|flyer's mind]]" to flee.

Quote from [[Carlos Castaneda]]:

> "They \[the sorcerers of ancient Mexico\]discovered that we have a companion for life. We have a predator that came from the depths of the cosmos and took over the rule of our lives. Human beings are its prisoners. The predator is our lord and master. It has rendered us docile, helpless. If we want to protest, it suppresses our protest. If we want to act independently, it demands that we don't do so." \[…\]
> 
> "I want to appeal to your analytical mind. . Think for a moment, and tell me how you would explain the contradiction between the intelligence of man the engineer and the stupidity of his systems of beliefs, or the stupidity of his contradictory behavior. Sorcerers believe that the predators have given us our systems of beliefs, our ideas of good and evil, our social mores. They are the ones who set up our hopes and expectations and dreams of success or failure. They have given us covetousness, greed, and cowardice. It is the predators who make us complacent, routinary, and egomaniacal." \[…\]
> 
> "The predators give us their mind, which becomes our mind. The predators' mind is baroque, contradictory, morose, filled with the fear of being discovered any minute now. "I know that even though you have never suffered hunger, you have food anxiety, which is none other than the anxiety of the predator who fears that any moment now its maneuver is going to be uncovered and food is going to be denied. Through the mind, which, after all, is their mind, the predators inject into the lives of human beings whatever is convenient for them. And they ensure, in this manner, a degree of security to act as a buffer against their fear." \[…\]
> 
> "\[The sorcerers of ancient Mexico\] reasoned that man must have been a complete being at one point, with stupendous insights, feats of awareness that are mythological legends nowadays. And then everything seems to disappear, and we have now a sedated man." \[…\]
> 
> "what we have against us is not a simple predator. It is very smart, and organized. It follows a methodical system to render us useless. Man, the magical being that he is destined to be, is no longer magical. He's an average piece of meat. There are no more dreams for man but the dreams of an animal who is being raised to become a piece of meat: trite, conventional, imbecilic." \[…\]
> 
> "The only alternative left for mankind," he continued, "is discipline. Discipline is the only deterrent. But by discipline I don't mean harsh routines. I don't mean waking up every morning at five-thirty and throwing cold water on yourself until you're blue. Sorcerers understand discipline as the capacity to face with serenity odds that are not included in our expectations. For them, discipline is an art: the art of facing infinity without flinching, not because they are strong and tough but because they are filled with awe.') "Sorcerers say that discipline makes the glowing coat of awareness unpalatable to the flyer," \[…\]
> 
> "The grand trick of those sorcerers of ancient times, was to burden the flyers' mind with discipline. They found out that if they taxed the flyers' mind with inner silence, the foreign installation would flee, giving to any one of the practitioners involved in this maneuver the total certainty of the mind's foreign origin. The foreign installation comes back, I assure you, but not as strong, and a process begins in which the fleeing of the flyers' mind becomes routine, until one day it flees permanently. A sad day indeed! That's the day when you have to rely on your own devices, which are nearly zero. There's no one to tell you what to do. There's no mind of foreign origin to dictate the imbecilities you're accustomed to. "My teacher, the nagual Julian, used to warn all his disciples," don Juan continued, "that this was the toughest day in a sorcerer's life, for the real mind that belongs to us, the sum total of our experience, after a lifetime of domination has been rendered shy, insecure, and shifty. Personally, I would say that the real battle of sorcerers begins at that moment. The rest is merely preparation." "The flyers' mind flees forever," he said, "when a sorcerer succeeds in grabbing on to the vibrating force that holds us together as a conglomerate of energy fields. If a sorcerer maintains that pressure long enough, the flyers' mind flees in defeat. And that's exactly what you are going to do: hold on to the energy that binds you together."

### Hunger has increased for some of us, why is that?

Well, there is [this](http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_m1200/is_n22_v150/ai_18947098/) – "How the brain knows when eating must stop – vagus nerve responds differently to each nutrient to decode what and how much has been eaten":

> At some point during a meal, the brain instructs the hand to put down the fork: The diner has had enough. The brain sends this message before all the food has left the stomach and entered the bloodstream. In probing what signals satiety, psychologists have identified a novel method by which the brain evaluates the contents of the gut.
> 
> The vagus nerve, which carries two-way communication between the gut and the brain, transmits distinctly different patterns of electric signals in response to carbohydrates and to protein in the gut, finds Gary J. Schwartz of Johns Hopkins Medical Institutions in Baltimore. These signals largely reflect gut wall contractions-mechanical motions that mix and grind up food, he reported at last week's Society for Neuroscience meeting in Washington, D.C.
> 
> There's another component of the vagus nerve's reaction to protein. Schwartz suspects that hormone-like peptides produced by the gut in response to food are responsible for amplifying the signals triggered by the motions of the stomach and small intestine.
> 
> Most scientists had assumed that nerves sample gut contents through receptors that, like taste buds on the tongue, directly discriminate specific classes of chemicals being eaten, Schwartz notes. His data from anesthetized rats now indicate that this gut-level "tasting" may rely instead on indirect cues from nonspecific features of the digestive system, such as gut wall motility. Because other stimuli can also elicit both these motions and peptide production, the brain apparently decodes what's eaten-and how much-from the distinctive pattern of the vagus nerve's response to each nutrient, together with other information the brain receives from the gut.
> 
> Most nutrient absorption occurs in the stomach and duodenum-the upper segment of the small intestine. As Schwartz and his team infused glucose, a sugar, or peptone, a protein, directly into the duodenum, they recorded both gut wall movements and the corresponding signals to the brain.
> 
> In terms of the intensity and timing of contractions, and the corresponding intensity and duration of the vagus nerve's electric firing, "2 calories of the protein produced about a 30 to 40 percent larger \[and longer\] response than did 2 calories of glucose," Schwartz found.
> 
> He suspects that part of the effect may be mediated by the mast cells of the immune system. Present throughout the gut, these cells "are almost the perfect, ubiquitous transducer," he explains. "They can change a mechanical, thermal, or chemical stimulus into a neural signal." Moreover, he notes, vagus nerve fibers winding throughout the finger-like villi lining the duodenum "are in a perfect position to taste what's happening to those mast cells."
> 
> "These are wonderfully coherent, novel, and interesting results," says Gerard P. Smith of Cornell Medical Center in White Plains, N.Y. While "we knew the gut talks to the brain over these \[vagus nerve\] fibers, what no one before has shown us is how the fibers respond to nutrients by changing their neural firing."
> 
> Adds Jaak Panksepp of Bowling Green (Ohio) State University, this information may prove "very important in learning what terminates a meal." However, he notes that over a day or so, the body adjusts its calorie consumption based on past meals and current needs. Therefore, Schwartz's new findings, he says, may have small consequences for how animals adjust their 24-hour caloric intake."

### As far as keeping sensations below the neck, I think I've missed to read it. If it's not too much to ask, can you point it out?

_"As far as keeping sensations below the neck, I think I've missed to read it. If it's not too much to ask, can you point it out ? Is it in regard to physical/inner sensations or in regards to feelings/behaviors/actions that arise & projected to external world (i.e. in [[The Work]] – keep your anger below the neck)?"_

Just for the sake of clarity here, "keeping emotions below the neck" does not mean not expressing emotions, it means not allowing emotions (or emotional energy) to be "usurped" by the intellect and converted into theories etc. It is better to simply express the emotion as it is, in some way or other.

### Is it less effective if I listen to the audio with headphones?

I think earphones are totally fine! I would use them myself in many situations.

### I have difficulty breathing, my belly can't go up properly, any advice?

_"I have difficulty breathing with my stomach/chest and up, my belly can't go up properly,any advice?"_

A couple of things that might be useful. Are you maybe not moving the diaphragm correctly – it needs to tighten downwards when you breath in, and then relax back up again into a dome shame when you breath out to fully expel the old air, it should come naturally once you are used to the movement. Do a quick google image search on 'diaphragm' – If you can picture it, it might help, and you should be able to feel it pull down and flatten out as you breath in – which will also lift your ribs once you are breathing deeply.

Another thing might be your posture, perhaps it would be worth you doing some simple breathing exercises standing up, to stretch everything out and give you more capacity, whilst paying attention to keeping your spine straight as well – as you breath in. It's hard to know exactly what the difficulty is without being there in person and seeing you breathe, to see how your body is moving, but it sounds like there is some constriction, maybe some tension where there shouldn't be. Then for the full 3 stage breathing, the idea is to carry on breathing in, as the diaphragm contracts, so that the air fills right up, and the rib cage expands, because of of the pressure and from the contraction of the diaphragm muscle at the bottom, and the air filling, allowing the chest to lift (especially good stretching with 3rd stage, putting your hands behind your shoulders to really stretch the chest out), and NOT from 'pulling' upwards by hunching your shoulders (keep those shoulders relaxed!).

All this will help maximise your breathing capacity. Another thing might be that you are not relaxed, you shouldn't be tensing the other muscles around your torso / stomach / chest, because that tends to act 'against' the expansion, and lock your body into a stiff position and not allow things to move. So, perhaps practice just some simple deep breathing, basically _relax_, and try to feel the air fill your body, and feel everything moving in the right way without becoming tense, keep a good awareness of the position of your body, and maybe that will help. Stick with it!

### For those using melatonin, is it advisable to take melatonin before or after the program?

It would be best to take it afterwards as the melatonin can make you sleepy.

Tips
----

### Try not to swallow

*   _"While doing the breathing try NOT to SWALLOW. Swallowing is a defense mechanism, or distracting "outer barrier" of emotional armoring. If you must swallow, do it, but try to keep it to a minimum."_
*   _"I'd just like to add to the discussion about the swallowing, that as I've come to understand it the swallowing per se isn't what should be avoided, but the swallowing functioning as a defense mechanism."_

I would suggest, that if you guys feel very dry in the mouth or throat please DO swallow – don't try to concentrate all your will power to stop every swallowing reflex that emerges – waste of good energy! This Bioenergetic therapist said on the phone that when these defence mechanisms come and if they are very strong, it is sometimes just better to let them do their business. The main point is to KNOW and IDENTIFY this mechanism. Later it will diminish, with every little "battle" you've won.

### Don't force it!

If you feel too tense in the ribcage, neck, back or any other area while doing the breathing, this means you are doing TOO MUCH. If you have not done these kind of breathing patterns before do not try to take the "whole cake" right from the start! In my experience it is highly more effective when you take less air but don't FORCE it – in this way you remain more relaxed and the process functions correctly.

### Be patient

Believe me, the benefits and effects can be going on "under the surface" for some time before things "sort out" in your awareness – IF they come to awareness; sometimes they just sort out and go away. That is, a lot will sort out without you having to do anything except just let the process do its thing. If you try to have "intent" other than assimilating the concepts of the prayer – which is designed to NOT constrain any activity of the subconscious – or if you try to add "bells and whistles", you could be circumventing your own best interests.

So, please, just relax into it. It's as simple as it can be and all you have to do is practice it regularly. If you can only do part of it on any given day, do some deep, normal breathing (in through the nose, out through the mouth) and the prayer/meditation before sleeping.

### Breathing during the meditation

In response to the confusion about whether or not to use pipe breathing while meditating, my intention was to suggest that IF YOU WANT TO or FEEL like it, you CAN do a few pipe breaths (like 20) to get you into the meditation, and then just relax into deep breathing, in through the nose, out through the mouth. At some point, many of you will "zone" and you'll be breathing however your body wants to.

### Loud noises

As for loud noises – that's not uncommon either. They are like inter-dimensional sonic booms – EM bursts from your higher self in some cases.

You may have electronic glitches around you, things may break, vivid dreams that process out unhappy events, there's just a whole array of interesting phenomena that can come into play. Don't pay any attention to it, it's just roadsigns, not the destination. Your job is to achieve the goal: the BEing that is described in the prayer.

### Itching nose

I think that if your nose itches, scratch it and then gently bring your attention back to breathing or meditating. If you feel like you have to move, do it and bring your attention back to what you are doing. Maybe have a pillow handy if you feel the urge to punch something or hug something.

### On the go

You can do the whole program, or you can do just the three stage breathing... or three stage breathing and warrior's breath, or just pipe breathing while you drive to work, or when you want to take a breather. If you do those things, then you don't need to do the whole program in one sitting... you can just do the meditation before going to sleep. In fact, doing JUST the meditation in bed to put yourself to sleep is good practice because it sets your FRV for sleep time so that the essence/higher self can continue to work while you sleep, clearing out old, stuffed emotions, bringing forgotten stuff to the surface so it can be processed, and so on.

### Practicing with a common schedule

It also might be a good idea to reserve doing the whole program on one or two days a week, and only do the other breathing parts as needed, and just the meditation before sleeping. Perhaps if we reserve _Monday and Thursday evenings for doing the whole program_, and we know that everyone else is going to be doing it on those days at some time, it will add force to our practice? You can assume, with the global presence of the people on this forum, that at any given time on those specified days, your practice will be simultaneous with someone else's or overlapping in time.

Of course, if you are ill or dealing with a specific problem, you might want to do it every day for a bit, but that really isn't necessary. What is MOST important to try to do every day is the meditation before sleeping.

### Emotional cleansing may not necessarily be obviously "emotional"

_"But there is some resistance of a different kind, as it doesn't happen during the exercises. As it happens, shortly after I started practicing regularly I would experience odd pangs of sharp pain in the upper left portion of my abdomen. This was the kind of pain I never experienced before. As I continued with exercises this pain continued and it culminated last weekend with pretty severe attack – first it started like a big spasm of abdominal pain – of such intensity that i was literally on the floor hugging my knees, then it sort of radiated in waves towards my sternum where it became more of a pressure then pain, like someone has put a heavy weight there. For a moment I thought I am experiencing a heart attack. This lasted several minutes and then pain radiated towards my throat and arms and slowly fazed out._

I am pretty sure this is the part of some sort of cleansing process,"

This is interesting and I agree that it could very well be a cleansing of some emotional event that was stuffed in the tissues and had no other way to get out. It could even be past life stuff. You just never know and others might want to be alert to the fact that all emotional cleansing may not necessarily be obviously "emotional." That's why it is helpful to report experiences so that others can see what is going on and compare their own experiences to know that it is all within the normal range. Heck, we may even discover some things!

### Mucus in the throat

I notice there is enormous quantity of mucus being produced in my throat, so much so that i literally need to spit it out regularly during the day. With it I have this funny notion this mucus is toxic and I wouldn't dare to swallow it. Once I had to swallow it – I did feel sick immediately afterwards. Dunno if this was autosuggestion – in any case i thought it was worth reporting.

### Once you are "settled in"

When you get to the point that you can do the breathing more or less mechanically, then it is time to begin to focus on the meaning of the words of the prayer. If you just approach them with the curiosity of a child who really wants to know, you may have interesting results.

### When you are 'zoning', things are STILL happening!

Ya'll just remember that when you are "zoning" (whether you actually go to sleep or not) things are STILL happening. I'll never forget something the Cs said to me:

> Cassiopaean session 23 September 2000
> 
> Q: Okay, I want to find out about this Jack and the Beanstalk and the "giant meaning" you have talked about in the recent past. Not only that, but you have continuously hinted that something is just around the corner, and we are getting to the point where we are thinking that there is just simply not going to be enough time to do anything. Ark's got 800 pages of Maxwell to go through; he can't stop working to do that; 800 pages of equations is a lot of work – like months of hard work – and, time is passing – four years have gone by, and zip! I'm not getting impatient here, but time is going and you guys are 6th density and it means nothing to you... but we're getting older. What we are supposed to do, if we are supposed to do something to make the connection for things to move?

I mean, this thing called time has a profound effect on physiology whether you guys notice it or not!

If I finish that, the Lord is willing, the creek doesn't rise, and I manage to keep breath in my body, I might, in another five years get all the material we have so far on the web. But, it is an enormous undertaking. Day and night, either writing in my head, getting ready to write, writing, or going back over what has already been written. Every day. Consumed with it.

The "Jack in the Beanstalk" reference goes back to an even earlier session, 31 October 1998:

> Q: Well, we KNOW that! (A) Now, apparently, everything is going well, and for a while, I think I will have more time to start some real research, and I would like some advice because we don't know how long I will have this time. What would be the first priority for me to work on for now?

> A: The journal, to start with. One's objectives should be outlined. The scientist usually begins with this for "fine tuning." We see more opportunities coming though. We led you to the garden, and you planted the beanstalk. Now watch it grow, Jack!
> 
> Q: (L) That doesn't mean there is going to be a giant going around saying "fee, fie, foe, fum," does it?
> 
> A: The giant is in the meaning.
> 
> Q: You mean we gotta kill a giant?
> 
> A: No.
> 
> Q: (A) I also wanted to ask if I should be more active and ask more questions in future sessions, or to ask less questions and work more on my own?
> 
> A: Questions open the doors, Arkadiusz.
> 
> Q: (L) I want to go back to this beanstalk!
> 
> A: Well, what of the fable?
> 
> Q: (L) Well, Jack got these beans and planted them and they grew. He climbed the beanstalk and figured out how to transform or kill the giant, and got the treasure, and ran away and chopped the beanstalk down so the giant couldn't get him. (F) I remember that he used the beanstalk to get to the same level with the giant. (L) Well, which does it mean? Does he use the beanstalk to rise to the level of the giant, get the treasure and live there, or does he run away with the treasure and chop down the beanstalk?
> 
> A: Take your pick.
> 
> Q: (L) Well, the essence of the story is that Jack was successful. He planted these magic beans and they REALLY grew, like OVERNIGHT! He woke up the next day and the beanstalk reached all the way to the clouds – that is how fast it was. I guess that what you have been doing in this job is planting magic beans that are gonna take off and grow like crazy and be a ladder you can climb to some giant success! If I remember correctly, there was a harp involved.

### Emotional reactions as a reminder

I've found it enormously helpful to view typical negative emotional reactions as ongoing subconscious equations being worked out on the level of the body-mind. Automatic emotional reactions are just the 'difference' that I feel between an expectation and what I actually get. I've discovered plenty of evidence of expectations hiding beneath the surface that I didn't know I had using this approach.

Notes
-----

### The best times of day for different exercises

Let me suggest that ya'll do pipe breathing (three stage breathing) in the mornings, round breathing early in the evening on the days you do that (2 times a week unless you have left it off for a reason) and JUST the meditation, starting with a few pipe breaths in the evenings. It appears that the 3 stage breathing is too energizing and the round breathing can bring up disturbances to sleep.

### Resistance of the Predator's mind to meditation – do what IT doesn't want to do

_"The [[Predator’s mind|predator/flyer's mind]] (foreign installation) is really hanging on when I'm doing the breathing meditation process. I begin yawning as soon as the pipe breathing starts (even if I do it in the morning) and continues through (I breathe through), and there is excess saliva production (I mange to hold off until absolutely necessary and swallow on a 'hold' to maintain the breathing pattern. As others have said, at several points in the ba-ha breathing, I drift off ('skip in the record') into a thought, and it seems as if hypnotized and my breathing almost stops. It takes a conscious effort to to get the breathing back on track and the thought out of my mind. Also, whilst lying down, I was aware of a distracting pain in my right foot, big toe and the one next to it (detail?). Discipline is definitely required to keep moving right through the programme."_

And the beauty of it is that ANYONE can practice this discipline because it is so simple a program. Believe me, the small efforts you make to just bring your awareness back, to get back on track, will pay off big time!

I used to go through the same things. When I started meditating years ago, it was amazing how frequently my nose would itch to the point of driving me mad! It NEVER itched if I wasn't trying to meditate! And how many times did I catch my mind wandering away from counting my breathing, or reciting my prayer!?

You just patiently, over and over again, pull your awareness back in line and just DO it! It took me a few months of practice before I started have BIG effects, but I sure did have a lot of benefits that added up over days from the beginning, including helping me sleep better, being calmer during the day, better able to cope with stress, and so on.

### Don't jump the gun – for now, please follow the program as it is

The recent focus of discussion around the breathing program has turned a little bit towards cleansing, releasing of blockages a.s.o., which I think is an essential need for must of us. But beyond that we have been reminded again and again that knowledge protects and ignorance endangers. We would most probably be much better of in this environment, if we could establish at least a limited communication with our higher centers and receive some assistance. I felt this need for long time and it motivated me to undergo hypnotherapy sessions and ask for assistance from my inner physician and subconsciousness. I reported this in earlier threads and it has yielded some results. The breathing sessions have brought it one step further and I have hope that all of us will be able by one way or the other to establish a direct connection with our higher centers as the C's suggested.

Please note what the Cs said in the last session:

> A: Keep in mind that in order for the techno-spiritual techniques to work, the people of the "blood" must be purified and their chakras must be "connected".
> 
> Q: (L) So basically, we can recapitulate by saying that people need to learn to breathe. Breathing can change things in their physiology. And also they need to use the breathing to get themselves into a meditative state, or a state where they can do the bioenergetic breathing, which then helps them to release karmic and current life programs and issues and get a cleansing. Once they've started to become cleansed, then they are able to – and this is supposed to be interspersed with, as I understand it – continuous input of data and information. They did say that you use this to deal with reality. This meditating and breathing is not an escape, this is a healing. Meanwhile, you're supposed to at the same time – throughout the day – you're supposed to be paying close attention to reality and not falling into illusion. Okay, so we've got that part of the program. And then once these people begin to clear out their traumas and their programs and get free of illusions and so forth, that means that they are then better able to use facing reality and thinking with a hammer to connect their chakras. And that, I assume, means connecting to their higher intellectual center and higher emotional center. Of course, you connect the emotional center first and then the intellect comes in also. So, in other words, they become kind of like connected with themselves in the future so to say. Am I on track so far?
> 
> A: Yes. But we would like to point that all "souled" individuals are members of a fragmented 6D soul/being. When they begin to connect with their future/higher centers, this implies a natural connecting with the other members of their soul group.

I want to suggest that you do not try to "jump the gun". I sorta suspect that if the Cs had thought that anyone needed to do more than the breathing and meditating right now, they would have said so.

Keep in mind that, the instant any system is formulated for a positive purpose, there will be a whole raft of "thoughts" or "novel ideas" that just appear in the mind that seem to be useful, but can be due to either the predator's mind, programming, or thought wave transmission from STS sources with the intent of destroying your ability to actually make positive progress.

The Cs did not suggest using Reiki with the breathing/meditation, or anything else. So please, for now, all of you just follow the program as it is.

ADDED: Clearing emotional blocks/burdens and karmic blocks/burdens is the prerequisite for doing anything else. Notice also that the main OTHER thing that is continued throughout this process is "knowledge input on a continuous basis."

Your ability to discern is based on being able to remove your blinders and increase your knowledge. The very fact that you still think that you can think with the way you think is evidence that you are not free of emotional blocks nor have you increased your knowledge.

Think about it.

### The process

As I said, it's a process (The EE Program), and it will go at a sligthly different pace for each individual, or with emphasis on one area or another according to your need.

Now, let me give you a little preview of what can/may happen over the next couple of months as you continue this practice.

What you are doing is establishing a living relationship with the immeasurable force of your own higher being. Just being able to have definite experiences with this psychic or non-material existence is the first step and plays a primary part in true initiation.

Material life is the infinite or cosmic self housed in a body. The body is important only as insofar as it is that housing (though that housing is very important for a number of reasons I won't go into here). What is important for you now is understanding that the cosmic self/essence has a "house." The metaphor of the horse, cart, driver and master is useful here.

The "master," or higher self intelligence possesses a deeper faculty than material intelligence, because it exists in a state of limitlessness, which gives great breadth to its intelligence, while the brain of the body, which is what enables us to manifest "mind" is limited by material horizon. The higher intellectual center has the ability to perceive everything at one moment. This greater range of observation would obviously burn out the circuits of the physical brain which runs a lot of programs and loops that are tied to physical circuits. So this is why, mainly, zoning occurs. You simply could not handle what your higher self perceives. Not yet, anyway.

So, at present, you are being introduced to your immeasurable higher self and undergoing a process of psychic/psychological/emotional purification. You are "cleansing the temple," so to say.

Repeated practice of this process is this act of purification/cleansing and preparation for the union of the higher self and the earthly self. You are, in a sense, taking "light baths" every time you practice the meditation.

Many traditions focus on this task for years and years and years, turning it into a protracted, painful process. In many traditions, those who seek this sort of communion/purification, often spend YEARS getting to the stage that most of you have achieved after just a couple of weeks of practice. So don't be put off by the fact that it may take a couple or few months to clear away the programs and the dross of emotions that are a result of programming. You are preparing your vessel so that the higher self can actively "inhabit" or directly interact with your physical brain/mind.

The confusions and problems with most of what gets passed off as esoteric teachings in modern New Age contexts (not to mention older teachings that miss the mark) are caused by people seeking to manifest the force of the immeasureable higher self without either understanding or preparing for it. They seek to pour new wine in old bottles, as the "scriptures" say. They seek to pour into their own twisted and distorted selves (twisted and distorted by a pathological reality) the most amazing power in the Universe – the essence of their higher selves.

And so, the necessity for the cleansing.

So, what is actually happening for all of you is that your are generating the penetrating "astral light" that cleanses away all that stands between you and your true, higher self.

Even with the purest method such as we have here, this can take varying amounts of time according to what the life experiences of the individual are. In some cases, it can happen very fast. In other cases, it may take a little longer and may seem like it is going nowhere, but then, without warning, the light will break through and bathe and cleanse your entire being.

Keep in mind that the higher self does not measure time by material methods and it takes some getting used to – the manifestation of a limitless, timeless force.

Your own higher self/essence is directing the cleansing process. I suspect that some of the effects that many of you are reporting (lights, pressures, etc) are you feeling your own higher self/essence at work.

At some point, when the cleansing has proceeded to a certain point and the higher self is enabled to interact more directly – that is, take charge of the cart, driver and horse, it can begin to provide leadership and direction to your life. Now, since this is YOU doing it, don't think that it is going to feel like some stranger coming in and taking over. The only way I can describe it is like how you feel being an adult relative to having been a child. You make this leap into your true, grown-up self, and all that childish stuff just sort of falls away. You will become a being that is at once human and at the same time, divine. You will no longer identify with your body or false personality, it will, instead, become a "house" or an "instrument."

What will happen is that your self, your being, will take on a new quality of vitality and range and initiative. You will become strong in areas where you once were weak. You will experience the constant guidance of the higher self with its "eyes of the soul." This guidance will be active in the work of your hands and the words of your mouth. You will feel this guidance in the form of protection, also – you will have the ability to perceive danger. Your essence will guide you to acquire the knowledge you need on a practical level to protect the material being from unnecessary harm. The higher self, knowing the power of material attraction, helps you to be aware and strong so that you will continue to be a channel of the higher self into the material world.

So, that is just a brief outline of the initial benefits to come. There is more, of course, but let's save that for later.

### Emotional Cleansing: Peeling the Onion

(After a lot of experiences were posted by the forum members...)

Looks like some people are getting some action. I guess I'm gonna have to either record a talk about what to expect, or write it. Clearing stuff is not going to be easy for everyone. I think it depends on the depth of the individual. Deeper people just simply suffer more. That's my take on it, anyway. Of course, it's no comfort when you are going through it.

The good thing is: it IS a changing of reality from the inside out. It is a step toward 4 D awareness. Those people who go through it in advance, are way ahead of the game, I think. And I'm sure that some people can go through something like this without a breathing/meditation program, but just simply via shocks – but that's horribly unpleasant too. Probably even worse.

The first stage of the process was, as I have described in [[Amazing Grace|Grace]], back in the mid-to-late 80s. That was a direct result of my breathing/meditation practice which ya'll are doing pretty much as I did it then.

Thing was, I meditated EVERY night along with doing controlled pipe breathing at the beginning (only) of the meditation. I would then relax into a more normal breathing pattern as the meditation proceeded.

So, that was the first BIG layer of stuff that came off.

Following that, there were a LOT of changes in my life that, looking back, I directly attribute to this cleansing. Each change led step by step to the Cs Experiment. Now, everyone isn't going to go through this exactly the same because everyone isn't gonna be channeling as I did it. So just take this in a general way.

The Cs project was a more conscious way of accessing what was in my subconscious/superconscious. Most of ya'll will get there without having to go through this painful, protracted process. I'm just a really stubborn, strong-willed person and often my stubbornness manifests in resistance to what is good for me. I'm hoping ya'll can avoid a lot of that misery.

Anyway, so the Cs project was, in itself, an initiation and a cleansing of nonsense in my head, belief centers, emotions, what have you. And it was seven months after that began, in February of 1995, that the next big layer came off. So, we are talking about a spread of about ten years in between two of the major events. I think it had to be that way for me because if I had to go through it all at once, it probably would have killed me.

The fusing of my emotional center began in February, as I mentioned, and it was one heck of a process! It was like losing my mind. It is recorded in the sessions though in a very obtuse way. I did NOT want to tell ANYbody what was going on in my head/innards. So I tried to ask questions about it without being too direct. Oddly enough, there was a "death link" to the event which makes me wonder about PepperFritz's death in a new way. It was "Frank's" father. He committed suicide. The thing is, he looked a LOT like my grandfather and I really felt a connection to the old guy even though I only interacted with him a few times. So, it was kind of a trigger when he died, I guess. Anyway, here is the clip from the session when I first asked about it. (Interestingly, it was my grandfather's birthday):

> Cassiopaean Session 11 Feb 1995:
> 
> Q: (L) Well, I have some personal stuff I would like to ask about without mentioning it specifically, can I do that?
> 
> A: Whatever you desire!
> 
> Q: (L) Well, something has been going on with me internally and I just don't know what it is. I don't even know who I am right now. I am at odds with myself, it seems. What is going on? Why am I so irritable?
> 
> A: You are being defensive, letting go of old stuff.
> 
> Q: Well, I am trying not to be irritable.
> 
> A: You try too much. Stop attempting and just "Go with it!" There is no need to steer, no need to drive, just ride!
> 
> Q: Well, that is very hard for me to do when this energy threatens to overwhelm me.
> 
> A: You have always been a driver, that is the old stuff to let go of. Why resist? This is why you have been irritable. Your super consciousness is telling you something.
> 
> Q: (L) Why did this feeling begin when Frank's dad passed away? Why do I feel now that I don't know which way we are going to go?
> 
> A: That was a steppingstone, a "milestone", if you like.

Well, things didn't get much better. As I have said before, it was like having my solar plexus blown wide open and all the emotions in the Universe flowing through me like a hurricane. There were times when the only thing I could do was curl up in the bed and rock and cry and try to hang on to my sanity. I really did think I was going mad!

Dabrowski refers to it as "positive disintegration" and "disintegration" is a good word, but I'm not sure about the "positive" part – at least not while you are going through it.

The next time I tried to ask about it was a week later on Feb 18th. Again, I was really being covert about my question. I also think that the energy of this session, which was quite chaotic, reflected what was going on in me:

_"This is the session where I was asking the Cs about my state covertly. Notice that I say "a week ago" because I wanted it to seem like a single event and not an ongoing thing because I felt like I was crazy._

Also notice the total craziness of this whole session which was a reflection of the state I was in. You can read from my notes what I thought about it. Any questions that were "outright" may be not so accurate, but I think that the "covert" questions were on target. "

There were a LOT of peculiar things about this whole session, as you will see. The whole "personality" that came through WAS D\_\_, as we were to find out later. But, also, there WAS some of the C's energy coming through. I think the first clue I had was when they abbreviated the word "Cassiopaea," which was odd... almost as though it were a clue that I was only going to make a partial connection.

Their awareness is primarily focused on meeting their personal needs, themselves, food, comfort, and the adult is worried about whether the roof leaks, whether the wind is going to blow the windows in and whether the wolf is going to come howling at the door, is that pretty close?

As you know, I am reading this book about Holocaust victims reincarnating and remembering their experiences at this time.

They are working with us to prepare us so that when we move into 4th we will have a head start on what's going on. They are bringing us up to where we already are because we came from 4th level to come here to do this originally, to set the frequency and hold it so that others can move to 4th level. We came from 4th density to do this. They are trying to give us enough information so that we will remember... (F) It is kind of like Hansel and Gretel going into the forest and leaving a trail of crumbs so that they can find their way out. We came back from 4th to 3rd to do what we've got to do and we're going back to 4th but we've got to leave a trail for us to keep connected to where we came from... something similar to that, in any event. (F) Is your mind exploding, D\_\_? (T) We, where we are now, don't grasp all this because we are not supposed to at this level.

There are several clues in the above session about the cleansing/moving toward 4 D process.

There's no words really, to describe it. You really do feel shattered, in pieces, hopeless and helpless and every emotion in the world is slamming right into your solar plexus.

Like I said, I often just curled up on the bed to rock and cry and feel sorry for myself at every stage of my life, and in every life I ever lived, and feel sorry for everybody else around me, those I hurt and who hurt me and didn't mean it... and so on. Gads! Well, I can't say I don't wish it on anybody because it is the real dark night of the soul – the valley of the shadow of death – and you have to go through it to be born. But I do wish it wasn't so hard and traumatic.

But it is worth it. It really is. To finally find that one little piece of yourself that is authentic, to grab it and hold onto it for dear life and begin to re-build yourself according to what is really YOU and not a bunch of crap that you had to invent to survive or crap that other people projected onto you.

You should also be able to suppress it a bit as long as you make appointments with yourself to let it all out later. I had to do that because I still had to take care of the kids and the house and everything. And it would come in waves... when it got really bad and I thought the pain was going to force me to leave the body, I would just rock and repeat: "this will pass, this will pass, this will pass... I feel it now, I felt it then, let me drain the last drop of it and it will pass..."

Somehow, that got me through it.

I started reading through the subsequent sessions to try to jog my memory about stuff. That was in February of 1995 ... and Tom French and Cherie Diez were in the picture. I had a lot of pressure on me to "act normal" and I did pretty much after the initial couple of weeks of feeling like I was falling apart "at odds with myself" "don't know who I am" "don't know where to go" and so on. But there were some things throughout that year where whatever went on in this second "cleansing" and opening, that now, in retrospect, seem to be connected.

For example, there was the accident therapy in the background (hmmm... maybe ya'll ought to get some bodywork done?) and then the strange episodes with the "eclipsing of realities" that came about in July of that year – a year after the Cs came. I think that was an event of making a choice at some subconscious level and even though I wasn't aware of it at the time, it set the stage for what happened later (divorce, Ark entering the picture, etc).

The dreams I was having were pretty powerful, too. A lot of stuff was just dumping. I was living a lot of the time between two realities. I could close my eyes and still see... I heard constant conversations kind of like what is described in "Operators and Things". Some of it was creepy. I slept with a radio playing all night long and put yellow bug lights on the porches and left them on all night.

If ya'll will read al-Arabi (Chittick's _[[The Sufi Path of Knowledge]]_) about unveiling, states and stations, you'll see that he pretty much describes a lot of this. Just ignore the Muslim gloss.

Apparently, you have to get used to running a stronger current on your circuits and after awhile, you acclimate.

I was interacting with a LOT of people. I didn't know where anything was going with the Cs or whatever – in fact, I was kinda depressed throughout because of the deterioration of my marriage and my attempts to continue to deny that. Then, I had the dream in September of that year about getting married and dancing and it left a powerful impression on me of hope even in spite of all the misery I was experiencing in my life. Then, I had the other event and saw Ark's face like a total hallucination. Like as real as the book in front of me on my desk.

So, the year proceeded and then, finally, 13 months later, I asked for a separation and a little more than 3 months later, Ark came. The interesting thing about this is that I actually DID go to Pensacola, and it was there that I had a dream about being kissed and waked up, kind of like Snow White or Sleeping Beauty. The kiss was so real, so intense, that it actually woke me up and I could still feel a "presence". Tom French and Cherie Diez were at the conference in Pensacola with us, and I told them about this strange "dream kiss" the next morning at breakfast. The odd thing about it was that from that moment, my attitude about everything changed. It really was like being awakened.

So, yeah, it can be a process and it can last for awhile and it seems that it can involve a lot of different elements and phenomena. It's actually kind of exciting to me to think about it now. Of course, at the time, I was SO afraid – just afraid of about everything. I was afraid of changes, of what I didn't know or understand, or what might happen tomorrow, or next week, and so on. A real worry wart needing to be in control of everything in order to feel semi-secure/safe. I was cranky when anything happened that was out of the ordinary or not what I wanted or expected. I had very little tolerance for anything or anybody that was not under control, so to say. I was grouchy, irritable, easy to fly off the handle, easily frustrated. I had no idea at that time that, 13 months later I would step out of my world and into a totally different reality where "safe" had a completely different meaning.

But it did take about a year to get used to the higher energy flow, the level of emotional content that went with it, and so on.

So, I hope this helps some of you to know some of the things that can happen and how to cope with it. Just remember, this is stuff that is living inside YOU... and you can either clear it out, or continue to stuff it and remain as you are. It's a choice.

But, from where I sit, it sure was worth it!

Inspirational Quotes
--------------------

> For all of you "going through the fire", just know that you are not alone. Also know that it doesn't last forever ... though at some points, it may be so intense that you think you are going mad. What's a few weeks of madness to pay for the bestowal of SEEing?

Most people avoid their (painful)emotions by suppressing them, in this process the individual believes that he has moved on, if someone looks at one’s own painful emotions, it's quite clear that you will experience suffering, but this suffering is needed for you to accept the emotion, understand the emotion, and move beyond it.

We all have our attachments to certain emotions, it is such a relief to deal with these emotions, you feel like reborn, a feeling which cannot be described.

From Barbara Marciniak")'s book _[[Bringers of the Dawn]]_:

> "One of the big secrets that has been kept from you as a species is the richness and wealth that accompanies emotion. You have been steered away from exploring emotion, because through emotion you can figure things out. Your emotions connect you with the spiritual body. The spiritual body, of course, is nonphysical, existing on the multidimensional sphere.."

You will also realize that the more you deal with your repressed emotions, the more easier you will be able to see yourself.

> You have to develop skills and abilities within a few hours that will allow you to travel a few decades in your own emotional evolution. You are going to have to travel the emotional highway, because the human body expresses itself through the emotions. That is the uniqueness and gift of your species.
> 
> First _you will need to open the emotional highways to areas that you_ have hidden from yourself in this particular lifetime. _Memories may_ flood in as this data is lined up inside you memories about events that were difficult for you at the time or perhaps that you did not have a context for. Some of you may uncover the events of extraterrestrial contact that all of you had when you were children. Some of you may uncover expressions of sexuality that you did not understand at the time you were involved in them, whether you were a passive or an active participant. Such things have been buried by the human emotional body because it is very sensitive to judgment, and the mental body passes tremendous judgment. The emotional body, linked to the spiritual body, hides from this.
> 
> \[...\]
> 
> _Many of you don't want to go beyond these emotional barriers and through_ your personal boundaries because it might be painful. _You'd like to say_ "abracadabra" and just have them be gone. Pain brings you feeling. If you can feel in no other way, sometimes, in order to capture your attention as a stubborn human, you create pain to show yourself the range of your abilities and to bring yourself into life. In this way, you can feel the richness of being alive.
> 
> _Most human beings are afraid of their emotional or feeling center; they_ are afraid to feel. _Trust your feelings no matter what they are._ Trust that they lead you to something and that the way you feel can bring you a realization. _You all want to be in life and be removed from it at the_ same time. You say, "Let me just be here and be a powerful person, but I don't want to feel or participate too much because it hurts too much and then I will get sucked down. I don't trust life."
> 
> When you are not afraid of feeling, and you move past judgment and allow yourself to feel all the ways you feel, you will have a tremendous breakthrough because you will be able to /ride feeling into other realities. /Some of you are afraid to feel and participate in this reality; let alone ride into other realities, because you do not trust your feelings. If you wish to have an acceleration, dive into something that brings up feeling. Stop skirting the issue so that you can think you are in control. Dive in the middle of it and then see if you are in control.
> 
> It's not that you don't know how to feel, _it's that you are afraid of_ your feelings. You don't know what to do with them when you have them. They bring up a sense of powerlessness within you, _so you associate_ feeling with a sense of, "Oh, no, I blew it." You have a boundary in your belief system that states that when something comes up that is emotional and brings pain or anger, then it is not good. It is time to stop tiptoeing around things and avoiding your emotions.
> 
> Anger serves a purpose. All of you want to get finished with it: you want to sweep it under the rug and act as if it is no good. You act like it is rotten vegetables, throw it out, and bury it in the back garden as if there is no purpose to it. _We are emphasizing that there is a purpose_ to fear and a purpose to anger. If you would allow yourselves to express and experience your fears, which might lead to the expression of your anger, you would learn something. Those of you who want desperately to avoid fear and anger, and who are really afraid of these feelings, have something great to learn through these emotions. _They are techniques_ that move you beyond your personal boundaries of identity and behavior, and you are simply afraid to experience this.
> 
> Most of the time, all you want is to be accepted. _You feel that no one_ will like you if you do certain things or feel certain ways, so you don't give yourself permission to have those certain feelings. That is where the anger comes from. You have anger because you make judgments about what you can and cannot do. If you do not give yourself permission to feel, you cannot learn. Feeling connects you with life.
> 
> Feelings serve a variety of purposes in human beings. We encourage all of you to please trust and cultivate and rely on your feelings. Understand that your feelings are your ticket to ride into multidimensional realities, where you must go if you are seriously playing this game. In multidimensional realities, you learn to hold and focus many different versions of yourself at once. Feelings can take you to these places, particularly feelings that you trust. _Many of you are_ very suspicious and masterful over your feelings. You will not allow certain feelings to come forward, or you judge them when they come up instead of observing where they take you or what they do for you.
> 
> Because you have a fear of something, _you keep yourself from_ experiencing it because you put up a wall that says, "If I go there, it is bad." _You put the brakes on. In actuality, your fear will eventually_ energize the experience into your realm of development because all thought is drawn into form based on the emotional influence behind it. _So sometimes the greatest thing to do is to simply say, "What the heck,_ I will go there. I surrender." Then deal with being there and don't worry about being centered while you are in your feeling center. If you intend to go into your feeling center and always be in control, you are not giving yourself the range of movement that is needed to ride the emotions that knock down boundaries and belief systems._"_
> 
> \[...\]
> 
> You must learn to love your emotions. _As long as you describe_ something as difficult, you are making it difficult. No one else is. You are resisting and judging the changes coming about. You are feeling that you do not know what is going on, and you wish to be in control. _Control_ is something very convenient and very handy. It must be applied at the right place at the right time, like super glue. Super glue in the wrong place doesn't do much good. Did you ever super glue your hands or lips together? You must learn to exercise control in the way you use super glue. If you screw up with super glue, you get stuck and you can't do anything. Control is the same way: you get stuck with it, and it sticks you to something that you don't need to be stuck to. You must be very selective about what you decide to control or not control. The old human pattern, or the paradigm that exists, says, "You must be in control."
> 
> \[...\]
> 
> Get clever. Next time you come into one of these emotional situations, say to yourself immediately, "Alright, I know what is going on; I'm not getting caught in this one. I know there is something here for me to learn, and something for me to change. I believe that I am guided and that I am following a blueprint, so I will check out what is in this for me by not judging it and by going with the flow. I request that all my changes come in joy and safety and harmony. That is my decree. Everything in my evolution I am intending is covered by that: I experience joy and safety and harmony. So I will go with this energy and see what is changing for me and what I need to give up."

> \[...\]
> 
> Feeling is what connects you to your humanity; feeling is what connects you to your emotions. Emotions connect you in this realm of existence to your spiritual body. _What we are saying is that emotions, or feelings,_ are the key to being alive in this reality. _Many realities exist without_ emotions, but in this reality they are your greatest gift. If you deny your emotional self in this lifetime, then you had best realize that you have hung it up. _If you are not going to be part of your emotional self,_ then you are never going to make the game we are talking about. You will simply be one of the masses who watches television and feels like a victim over and over again. If you are feeling pain within your emotional body, ask yourself why you believe the pain is there, what purpose the pain serves, and why you are choosing to create pain through your emotions. Why is it not your choice to create joy? All is choice. We need to remind you of this.

ADDED more:

The passages from _[[Bringers of the Dawn]]_ are excellent adjuncts to the program! Barbara Marciniak") certainly deserves many thanks for her work!

Here I want to quote a bit from Ibn al-Arabi") on the topic. This was my guide while going through all this:

> _"The experience of unveiling opens up an infinite expanse_ of previously unseen ralitites to the heart of the seeker. The realm into which the adept first enters is, after all, the "imaginal world," or world of the mind. Its byways never end. Unveiling opens the door to direct experience of the myriad worlds of Samsara.
> 
> "By being taken up in a state of love, yearning, fear, thanksgiving, dread, or any other psychological and spiritual attribute, the adept gains first-hand knowledge of the unseen realities which these states manifest.
> 
> "Like a madman, the possessor of the state loses his reason in the operpowering experience of his state.
> 
> "The word 'hal' or 'state' is derived from an Arabic root meaning self-transmutation, to change from one situation to another. The state is the situation, condition, predicament of change.
> 
> "A state is for you to be susbsistent, or annihilated, sober or drunk, concentrated or dispersed, absent or present... the experiences are broadly divided into pairs of opposites and you experience both. First one way, and then the other.
> 
> "The states are the divine tasks, the continual transmutation, self-disclosures of God within, the new creation at each instant.
> 
> "A state is that which enters in upon the heart without self-exertion or any attempt to attract it. One of its conditions is that it disappear and be followed again by its like, as in waves, until it subsides.
> 
> "The state is the changing of the attributes of the servant. Once they become established, they become 'stations.'
> 
> "States are bestowals and through the states come earnings.
> 
> "States signify certain dimensions of spiritual realization that differentiate the advanced seeker from ordinary individuals.
> 
> "The state also denotes special powers which are accruing to the seeker as a result of the station that may be acquired.
> 
> "The state is associated with several other terms which denote extraordinary feats or miracles which the friend of God may perform. These include exercise of governing control over secondary causes, bringing things into engendered existence, acting through resolve and producing effects in the outside world.
> 
> "The possessor of the state is he who is able to exercise these extraordinary powers.
> 
> "The possessor of the states engenders things through their resolve and throw the secondary causes far from them.
> 
> "When anyone sees such a servant in the extremity of his weakness during the states, he will remember God. God has singled out such as these for himself.
> 
> "The states present dangers to the person who experiences them. Though they are divine bestowals, there is always the risk of thinking one has deserved them and becoming proud, or losing mental equilibrium. The states are as trials that the traveler has to undergo.
> 
> "When the seeker is overcome by states, they become as madmen, and as a result they are no longer answerable to the Law. In this world, the state is an imperfection, while in the next world it is perfection.
> 
> "The 'inrush' arrives at the heart without self-exertion and enters in as a manifestation of one of the divine attributes.
> 
> "Sometimes the inrush is greater than the strength of the soul, so it rules over the soul. The state turns the seeker this way and that. If he does not master the state, there is danger of losing his rational faculty.
> 
> "The object is to increase the ability to receive 'inrushes' without being outwardly affected by them. "Without doubt, the possessors of the states exercise a penetrating power and governing control through which they are able to perform the putting aside of secondary causes."
> 
> – William Chittick"), _[[The Sufi Path of Knowledge]]_

> _"But, exercising governing control may also become a veil past which the seeker_ must ultimately move.
> 
> "Deception is the continuation of favors in spite of the seekers opposition. A seeker may be able to retain the state and perform the miracles without divine command and without punishment. This is due to God's deceiving of the servant and providing him with knowledge which demands practice and then deprives him of sincerity. Or, he may give the knowledge and deprive of the ability to practice. When you see this in yourself, know that he who has such an attribute is the object of deception and must penetrate this veil."
> 
> \[Excerpts from "Futuhat al-makkiyya" of Shaykh Muhyi al-Din ibn al Arabi, 1165-1240 A.D.\]
> 
> – William Chittick"), _[[The Sufi Path of Knowledge]]_

There is more about the physiological things that accompany the states and how to specifically identify them.

The main point I received from this was that the state must be controlled and absorbed into the system somehow as it confers power.

At the time I was going through some of this, I wrote to Ark:

> .... I am not entirely sure I can stand getting it this way! Holy Frijoles! For the past two weeks, it has been trickling and gushing in surges. Last night it really ripped through me.
> 
> And, I think I ought to consider that this sort of thing could also be some sort of frequency modulation.
> 
> So, yes, you are right that the internal state must stabilize and then the external conditions will change accordingly. But, if God had a suggestion box, I think I would suggest that we start earlier on these things so they can be done in smaller steps.

Then, there is also this, from [[George Gurdjieff]]:

> \[Lying\] can only be destroyed through suffering. ...The principle reason for it is that it is impossible to sit between two stools; you cannot acquire the new and preserve the old. ...This is a law: it is very difficult to climb the hill, but very easy to slide down it. ...I have already said before that sacrifice is necessary. Without sacrifice nothing can be attained. ...Nothing can be attained without suffering, but, at the same time one must begin by sacrificing suffering. ...To destroy suffering would mean, first, destroying a whole series of perceptions for which man exists, and second, the destruction of the force which alone can change the situation. The work \[of awakening\] consists in subjecting oneself voluntarily to temporary suffering in order to be free from eternal suffering. But, people are afraid of suffering. They want pleasure now, at once and forever. They do not want to understand that pleasure is an attribute of paradise and that it must be earned. If a man gets pleasure before he has earned it, he will not be able to keep it and pleasure will be turned into suffering. The way lies through suffering."

What Gurdjieff meant by "sacrificing suffering" is that one must give up the idea of focusing on the flesh as the means of "salvation." Whatever a person thinks they can DO to suffer and thereby gain knowledge, will be wasted. The object is to attain the knowledge. The suffering will manifest all by itself.

And, what Gurdjieff never spoke about, and he may or may not have been aware of it, was the nature of beings at higher levels who seek, consciously, to keep knowledge from us and who inflict all kinds of suffering on us either literally or symbolically, to drive us from the path. As a friend of mine says: "If ignorance were painful, everyone would strive for knowledge!" But, it is exactly the other way around. And, the majority of people cannot understand this nor do they wish to accept it. They want to make a profession of faith in Jesus, Mohammed, Buddha or Swami Gotcha and let them "take the burden" of "sin" while the people pursue pleasure at the very least, in terms of feeling that they have "done all that is necessary" and now it is just a matter of following some simple rules of minor suffering; i.e. abstention from foods or drink or certain sensual behaviors.

The truth is, becoming a vegetarian or teetotaler will do nothing to make one holy, though it can certainly "prepare the vessel." _(Editor: Since this was written, we've learned that vegetarianism") is the opposite of a healthy [[diet]].)_ But that is not really suffering – as those who go through this process well understand. No fleshly suffering undertaken to acquire knowledge will have any effect whatsoever except to support an illusion that one is "more holy than others." No fleshly abstention is useful except as a preparation for the "real thing".

When new knowledge is acquired, it can be accommodated up to a point, at which the whole system must then "come to pieces" and reorganize in a new way. This is, I believe, what the C's mean when they talk about knowledge and lessons and the relation of being at a given point on the learning cycle and "all conforming" to the new knowledge and awareness as a "spherical mosaic consciousness."

Seeing my own experiences in perspective, I saw this pattern, though it was certainly taking place in modest steps. Since 1985, it has been a constant series of internal reorganizations of the dissipative structure type. And, each reorganization has a serious effect on me in a physical way that has MEANING. I noted that when the suffering of knowledge came upon me, it manifested in ways that have MEANING in my personal experience. I lose my sight, voice, hearing, or ability to feel in a strictly physical way, and to use my limbs effectively. When I make the adjustments, bring the awareness to consciousness, pass through the emotional gauntlet, then the physical manifestations clear up.

So, in trying to fit all the pieces together, the suffering in the eyes shows me that I am SEEING something that is difficult to HOLD and that what I am seeing and trying to hold is an integrated WHOLENESS that comes from accessing and accumulating past, present and future.

I wrote more at the time I was going through these things, mostly to Ark. You will see that these things – this effort to understand the emotional cleansing – became seeds for the writing of _The Wave_:

> _\[From Laura's journal to Ark\]_

> There are many, many pieces to this mosaic. Many things from the distant past, my early life, my recent life, the present, and probably the future. And all of these things are like packets of energy being added into the system... and, it may be that the more evolved the system, the less energy is needed to destabilize the dissipative structure.

> The fact is that some sort of energy entered the system and I am now seeing in a different way, and have passed through a psychic storm of the flying apart of the structure, and it is manifesting physically in some damned uncomfortable ways!!!

> It is true that, at the time that the UFO showed itself to me and my children on August 16, 1993, that this was the beginning of the SERIOUS suffering relating to the present conditions. Prior to that, the problems were centered in the heart and reproductive system. Those problems have ceased. (But, we can see that problems with the heart relate to lack of joy and love and problems with the reproductive organs relate to denial of the self as creative.)
> 
> Now, having moved past the "lack of joy" because I was denying my own creativity, and having become joyful in discovery and dedication to knowledge, I find an entirely new set of effects!!!!
> 
> For example, for eleven months (there is that number 11 again) after the UFO sighting, my eyes and throat swelled shut every night at the same time and I was forced to exist on antihistamines to control this angioedema. Once the C material started coming through, some of that lessened, and it then became more of a period of relative calm and ease of movement followed by a leap in perception and understanding accompanied by massive physical "fall out." I thought I had been through the absolute worst back in late March and early April {1996} when I began to perceive the true difference between free will and lack of free will, sts and sto, subjectivity and objectivity. This perception caused me to take very definite actions in my life which included divorcing my husband and eliminating a lot of people from close association because I could clearly see that they were not interested in knowledge at all, but merely the idea that I might be able to teach them some means of manifesting materially or "creating" for selfish reasons.
> 
> At the human level, this created massive and overwhelming suffering, both physical and emotional. I was unable to speak for several weeks due to a major inflammation of the larynx, my eyes swelled shut and refused to respond to either anti-biotics or any other form of treatment, my ears rang constantly, and I had difficulty breathing and moving. Every joint and muscle in my body hurt as though they were broken and torn. Having a baby was easier than all that! I felt as though I were being literally crushed. I thought I would go mad from the pain and the grief of seeing what my life truly was and being forced, by virtue of my quest, to modify everything I thought I knew. At that point, I could have plunged back into denial for the sake of peace and keeping everything stable, but I had a dream that clearly told me that I was in mortal danger if I did not take immediate action.

We saw how this temperament may become the basis for a peculiar type of religion, a religion in which good, even the good of this world's life, is regarded as the essential thing for a rational being to attend to. This religion directs him to settle his scores with the more evil aspects of the universe by systematically declining to lay them to heart or make much of them, by ignoring them in his reflective calculations, or even, on occasion, by denying them outright. Evil is a disease and worry about evil is a disease in itself. Even repentance and remorse.. may be but sickly impulses.

There are others for whom evil is... a wrongness or vice in \[their\] essential structure, which no alteration in the environment, or any superficial rearrangement of the inner self, can cure, and which requires a supernatural remedy.

One with a high threshold will doze through an amount of racket by which one with a low threshold would be immediately waked. Similarly, when one is sensitive to small differences in any order of sensation, we say he has a low 'difference threshold.' His mind easily steps over it into the consciousness of the differences in question. And just so we might speak of a 'pain threshold' a 'fear threshold,' a 'misery threshold,' and find it quickly overpassed by the consciousness of some individuals, but lying too high in others to be reached by their consciousness.

And I was surprised that I had not understood this from the very beginning. My state of mind was as if some wicked and stupid jest was being played upon me by someone. One can live only so long as one is intoxicated, drunk with life but when one grows sober one cannot fail to see that it is all a stupid cheat.

I sought, not with indolence, but loboriously and obstinately for days and nights on end. I sought like a man who is lost and seeks to save himself – and I found nothing. I became convinced, moreover, that all those who before me had sought for an answer in the sciences have also found nothing.

It seems to me that we can achieve knowledge only by comparing the two sides, positive and negative, which have become separated from each other.

The visible world is only recognizable because of this separation from unity in which nothing and everything are at rest within each other.

> The material world is the tree of knowledge of good and evil. To eat of something is to become identical with it; for what you eat is what you will become. By identifying in any way with this world, we retain this fruit within us. We have identified our consciousness with it and become subject to it. Therefore, the material world is the result of separation. Our bodies are the material, manifested part of our true selves.

This striving toward the "God state" or unification of positive and negative forces is the source of all power in the manifested world. And, opening to the objective, but painful, reality of the material world is crucial to this process. Wherever negative forces are manifested, positive forces are present in the unmanifested state.
