**Éiriú Eolas** is a scientific stress-control, healing, detoxing and rejuvenation program that is proven to instantly control stress in high energy situations, detox one's body resulting in pain relief, relax and gently work through past emotional and psychological trauma, and regenerate and rejuvenate one's body/mind.

Éiriú Eolas is an Irish-Gaelic term that means "Growth of Knowledge". The Éiriú Eolas technique constitutes a revival of an antediluvian – and, until now, mostly forgotten – "techno-spirituality" – the spiritual techniques of humankind before [[The fall|the 'Fall']] as revealed by the [[Cassiopaeans]]. This is a modern revival of an ancient breathing and meditation program revealed as THE TOOL that will help one to relax and gently work through past emotional and psychological trauma, release repressed emotions and mental blockages that stand between an individual and True Peace, Happiness and ultimately, a successful, fulfilling life.

The Éiriú Eolas technique grew out of research conducted by the [[Quantum Future Group]] under the direction of [[Laura Knight-Jadczyk]]. The practice has been thoroughly researched and proven to work by the thousands of people who are already benefiting from this unique program. The effects are cumulative and results and benefits can be seen in only a very short time, sometimes after just one session.

The technique is in three parts:

1. Three-stage breathing: This is the fifteen minute daily routine that can stimulate all organ systems to detox and heal naturally. Cumulative effects of regular practice include body-mind balancing, regeneration of major organ systems leading to healing and rejuvenation. Results can be noticed after just one session and repeated practice can result in actual, physical regeneration.
2. Beatha (Life) Round Breathing: Also known as bioenergetic breathing, pioneered by Alexander Lowen, a student of Carl Jung. This technique rapidly and gently accesses and releases layers of emotional toxicity and psychological pain. Beatha can release deep stress and old abuse trauma including PTSD. This segment of the program contributes to deep oxygenation of all tissues and thus enhances the healing and body-rejuvenation process. Achieve Glorious Freedom from old programs and hang-ups! This is for weekly or occasional use, but is contraindicated during pregnancy or for people with any brain chemistry imbalance.
3. [[Prayer of the Soul]] Meditation: This is the centerpiece of the program and should be utilized every night before going to sleep. Employing an initial period of Pipe Breathing that rapidly induces a deep state of meditative relaxation, the Prayer consists of affirmations that enter deeply into the subconscious and trigger deep body and soul level healing and rejuvenation. The effects are cumulative and results and benefits can be experienced after only a short period of practice, often after just a single session!
