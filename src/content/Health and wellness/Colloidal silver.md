Colloidal silver is a well-known alternative remedy for bacterial or viral infections. This is produced by electrolysis of silver into distilled water. The lower the conductivity of the water, the smaller the silver particle size. If the particles are small enough, they remain suspended in the water.

Colloidal silver is inexpensive and easy to make and functions as a natural antibiotic and disinfectant. Much information on its use and production is to be found on the Internet.
