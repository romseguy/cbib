A **black magnetic center** is a perversion of the [[Magnetic center|magnetic center]]. A 'real' magnetic center forms through and guides a man in genuine esoteric work. By contrast, a black magnetic center is the result of a self-serving caricature of esoteric work, and pulls a man further towards it.

In the adept of [[service to self]], there is a certain development that parallels the positive development of genuine esoteric work, and a certain [[Fusion (Fourth Way)|fusion of the being]] that makes the aspirant less ambiguous and more focused. This can be said to take place around a 'black magnetic center,' a sort of concentration of negativity, where [[Wishful thinking|wishful thinking]] increasingly replaces [[Objectivity|objective]] understanding of reality. The aspirant comes to embody influences that run parallel to genuine [higher influences]([[A, B, and C influences]]), but which are deceptive caricature of these.

Diagrams from [[Gnosis (book trilogy)|_Gnosis_]] book one. Above is the diagram for the [[Magnetic center|magnetic center]], and below, for the black magnetic center. A black magnetic center grows by absorption of those A-influences (small black arrows) that run parallel to B-influences (thicker arrows). Instead of leading to contact with a genuine esoteric center (separate circle in top diagram), such development leads to profound self-absorption.

In his [[Gnosis (book trilogy)|_Gnosis_ books]], [[Boris Mouravieff]] discusses various abnormalities of the working and formation of [[Centers (Fourth Way)|centers]]. He mentions the possibility of strong development of the negative halves of the emotional and intellectual centers along with a strong moving center. Such individuals may even find similarly oriented [[Polar opposites or polar beings|polar opposites]], forming very destructive combinations.
