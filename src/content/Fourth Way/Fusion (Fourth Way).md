The term **fusion**, as used in [[Boris Mouravieff]]'s [[Gnosis (book trilogy)|_Gnosis_ books]], is the process of forming a [[Real I|'real' or 'permanent I']] out of the multiple [[little 'I's]] which generally constitute man's [[Personality (Fourth Way)|personality]].

The process is explained with the analogy of a vase filled with iron filings. In the default situation, each filing points in its own direction. [[Shock (Fourth Way)|Shocks]] may cause displacement and rotation of the filings, causing 'heat'. This heat is elsewhere referred to as the _struggle between 'yes' and 'no'._ Shocks and internal struggle may in time heat the filings to be hot enough so that they melt into a single block of iron.

From left to right: 1. the initial state of many [[little 'I's]]; 2. 'friction' becoming strong enough to potentially 'melt' and remold the self; 3. a solid, permanent [[Real I|real I]] as the result of successful fusion. (Illustrations from [[Gnosis (book trilogy)|_Gnosis_]] book one.)
