In [[Fourth Way]] discourse, the **magnetic center** is a function of [[Discernment|discernment]] which is formed in man as esoteric work proceeds beyond exterior, sleeping man.

The magnetic center is the seat of [[Discernment|discernment]] between influences which lead to esoteric development and influences which lead to submersion in illusions offered by the outer world. (See [[A, B, and C influences]].) It guides esoteric development while itself being formed and strengthened by this development.

Diagram from [[Gnosis (book trilogy)|_Gnosis_]] book one. The big circle is the world, the small black arrows are A-influences, and the thicker arrows are B-influences. Each smaller circle inside the big circle is a stage of development of the magnetic center, which absorbs B-influences and eventually leads man into contact with the esoteric center, the separate circle on the right.

A-influences surround man from the time he is born, and are the influences "of this world". B-influences have their origin in the esoteric center which is "not of this world"; by absorbing these, the magnetic center forms, and begins to lead man towards further B-influences and eventually towards contact with the esoteric center itself.

Exterior men ([[man number 1, 2, or 3|men number 1, 2, and 3]]), being without a stable magnetic center, live as [[Reaction machine|reaction machines]], pulled around by a constantly shifting anarchy of impulses in their [[Centers (Fourth Way)|centers]]. The influences "of this world", which guide exterior men both from the inside and from the outside, lead nowhere â€“ going in all directions, they add up to nothing.

In forming a stable magnetic center, man becomes man number 4, and the functions of body, feeling, and thinking come increasingly under the influence of the magnetic center. This harmonizes the functions to a relative degree, and they become directed towards conscious work.

If man is compared to a house full of servants who constantly quarrel about the run of the house, then the magnetic center can be seen as a group of servants who begin to set the house in order in preparation for the arrival of the owner of the house. The magnetic center eventually becomes a steward who runs the house in the absence of the master. Only then can the master, i.e. the [[Real I|real I]], take possession of the house. Forming a steward or magnetic center is a necessary intermediate stage in Fourth Way development.

Mouravieff's [[Gnosis (book trilogy)|_Gnosis_ series]] deals in great detail with [[little 'I's]], centers and the magnetic center.
