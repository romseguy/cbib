This idiom refers to the Coach parable and means not expressing or acting on initial emotional impulse.

The opposite idea is of the horses bolting away, i.e. launching themselves on some habitual course with great energy and fervor. This is also called running a program. Such a reaction is typical when for example some closely held belief is challenged. The reaction is nearly immediate and involves a strong value judgement. Usually the reaction is negative.

Consciously overriding this makes energy available for other uses. This also informs one on the existence of the program. If one never acted differently from one's programs, one would be so identified with them that one would not be able to recognize the programs as something separate from the self. Generally it is true that it is easier to rein in the horses before they bolt than after. Consciousness of the moment is important.
