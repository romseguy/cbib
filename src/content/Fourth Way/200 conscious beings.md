As reported in _[[In Search of the Miraculous]]_, [[George Gurdjieff]] said that **200 people belonging to the [[esoteric circle]] of humanity** could greatly change the world if they so chose.

However, maybe people developed to such a degree do not exist in sufficient numbers, or maybe they have determined that mankind is too soundly asleep and has not asked for change. One cannot know without oneself being close to this level.

This relates to the idea that there are specific windows of cosmic opportunity where consciousness can play a decisive role in determining a future direction. Many schools of thought see the present time is a fulcrum on which the future is balanced.
