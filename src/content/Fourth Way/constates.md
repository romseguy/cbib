The common meaning of constate is to mark or notice or establish or verify a fact.

In Mouravieff's _Gnosis_, the word constatation is used in the meaning of a definite result of self-observation. The constatation is neutral and does not imply a value judgement.

An example of the usage would be to say: "Through repeated self-observation, man constates that he maintains an entirely different outward attitude with the different people he interacts with."
