In the [[Fourth Way|4th Way]] discipline, the ideal state of perception is described as "Impartiality". Often mistaken for apathy or indifference, the actual connotation implies neutrality to all externalities. Knowledge of self is said to lead to a stable mind frame where the context of every situation, scenario, event, interaction, is acknowledged and ones actions follow appropriately as to conform to one's aims and the requirements of the situation.

One who embodies or strives to acquire this state of awareness is said to be stoic, unperturbed by the whims of emotions and the changes of fortune inseparable of the human condition.

What is ultimately sought is the ability to objectively experience the Universe through all centers, using thought, emotion and senses as a tool. This means that one is not swept away by automatically triggered reactions, be they physical, emotional or cognitive but that one uses all these capabilities for their "intended purpose," approaching a multifaceted and objective apprehension of the situation.
