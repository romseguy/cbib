In common usage, **center of gravity** means the dominant theme or central point of something. Physically, when an object is suspended from a point in the object and the vector of the suspending force passes through the center of gravity of the object the object hangs in equilibrium.

In the terms of the [[Fourth Way]], the center of gravity of a person relates to [[Man number 1, 2, and 3|the person's type]] â€“ i.e. 1, moving center; 2, emotional center; or 3, thinking center dominated. Likewise, a school can have a center of gravity. Social movements and cultures can have a center of gravity.
