In the [[Fourth Way]] cosmology, all that exists is seen in the context of a table of **hydrogens**, where the term 'hydrogen' simply means substance in general. Some hydrogens are material, some are information, others are spiritual energies for which there is no general description in human language.

Hydrogens are ranked based on their degree of 'density of vibration,' their 'vivifyingness' or 'intelligence.' This corresponds to how far removed each specific category of hydrogen is from the source of all creation or the Sun Absolute.

The term _higher hydrogen_ refers to those hydrogens which from the human point of view are no longer strictly matter or information.

The hydrogens are classified as follows:



*  Hydrogen:  H1 
  *  Description:  The substance of the Absolute
*  Hydrogen:  H3 
  *  Description:  The first level of the created. Not in human experience.
*  Hydrogen:  H6 
  *  Description:  the energy of the higher intellectual center. Manifests very rarely with humans.
*  Hydrogen:  H12 
  *  Description:  The energy of the higher emotional center, generally energy of intense emotion. Occurs rarely in humans.
*  Hydrogen:  H24 
  *  Description:  The energy of the lower emotional center and moving center.
*  Hydrogen:  H48 
  *  Description:  Normal impressions. This is the start of the impression octave in the human.
*  Hydrogen:  H96 
  *  Description:  Fire, rarefied gas, plasma, neurotransmitters, hormones, chemicals governing the biological organism. Abundance of H96 reflects as an impression of good health and radiant physical energy in humans.
*  Hydrogen:  H192 
  *  Description:  Air, the beginning of the air octave in the human.
*  Hydrogen:  H384 
  *  Description:  Water, products of food digestion.
*  Hydrogen:  H768 
  *  Description:  Food consumable for humans. Beginning of the food octave in the human.
*  Hydrogen:  H1536 
  *  Description:  Biological matter, generally not edible.
*  Hydrogen:  H3072 
  *  Description:  Inanimate matter, minerals, metals.


When in the context of a specific process involving the [[Law of Three]], hydrogens will be named carbon, oxygen or nitrogen, depending on the specific role they play in the process discussed.

The [[Ra]] term of 'intelligent energy' is somewhat similar to 'higher hydrogens' but is less specific.

The conceptual system involving hydrogens, triads, and [[octaves]] is complex and is described in greater detail in [[P. D. Ouspensky]]'s _[[In Search of the Miraculous]]_ and in [[Boris Mouravieff]]'s _[[Gnosis]]_ books.
