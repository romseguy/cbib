In [[Fourth Way]] discourse, **emotional thinking** refers to emotions taking over the thinking functions.

The [[intellectual center]] may be taken over by emotions and, directed by these, can construct arguments for defending some decision purely based on emotions. An example would be the fantastic rationalizations true [[believers]] have recourse to when defending clearly deceitful, even [psychopathic]([[Psychopathy]]) actions of their leaders.

Such 'thinking' is not affected by arguments appealing to reason. The intellectual center is isolated from these by a sort of wall formed by the emotional investment in one's belief. In the event of a long standing practice this can form [[Buffer (Fourth Way)|buffers]]. Emotional thinking is an example of the wrong work of centers.
