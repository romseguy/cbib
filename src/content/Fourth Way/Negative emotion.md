The term **negative emotion** has a special meaning in [[Fourth Way]] parlance. Even there, the word is used in two somewhat different meanings:

Firstly, negative emotion refers to what is generally called negative emotion, such as anger, fear, jealousy, envy etc.

Secondly, especially as used by the [[FOTCM|FOTCM]], the word can also indicate an emotion that does not accord with [[Objectivity|objective]] reality. This has nothing to do with whether the emotion is perceived as agreeable or not. Feeling happy as a result of [[Self-calming|self-calming]] or deliberately inducing oneself to believe in an illusion as an example of negative emotion in this sense.

Non-expression of negative emotions is an important precept of the Fourth Way. This does not mean that these should be ignored, quite the opposite. However, the energy of these emotions should not be wasted in mechanically expressing these but should rather be transformed and kept within the organism. This offers an opportunity for self-knowledge and saves energy which is then available for transformation.

[[P. D. Ouspensky]] and [[Boris Mouravieff]] discuss negative emotions somewhat differently. They however agree that [[Shock (Fourth Way)|shocks]] – which often take the form of disagreeable emotion – are an essential element of the Work. The central concept is consciously catching the automatic, mechanical reaction to the shock before the 'human machine' starts 'running' its habitual 'program.' The program itself may be to respond with anger, fear, denial or any other humanly possible response. In the place of doing this, the student may be deeply cognizant of the situation and of the program response and decide not to react in the habitual way. Because situations and habitual responses vary, we cannot give universally valid definitions of particulars.

According to Ouspensky, a transformed negative emotion does not become a 'positive emotion' in the sense of chaning from unpleasant to pleasant. Rather, it transforms into a deeper understanding that transcends the pleasant/unpleasant judgement typical to [[mechanical thinking]] and feeling. In Fourth Way theory, the coarser '[[Hydrogens (Fourth Way)|hydrogen]]' of mechanically received impressions has been transformed into a finer one, which can act as fuel for the [[Higher centers|higher centers]].
