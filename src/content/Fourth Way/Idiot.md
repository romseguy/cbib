_Idiot:_

L'Idiot

Main Entry: id·i·ot

Pronunciation: ɪd.iː.ət

Function: noun

Etymology: Middle English, from Anglo-French _idiote_, from Latin _idiota_, ignorant person, from Greek ἰδιώτης, one in a private station, layman, ignorant person, from _idios_ one's own, private; akin to Latin _suus_ one's own.

1.  usually offensive : a person affected with idiocy
2.  a foolish or stupid person

Fyodor Dostoyevsky wrote the famous novel [_The Idiot_](http://www.online-literature.com/dostoevsky/idiot/):

> The basis of the novel is that Myshkin is not bright, has not had much education, and traverses society with a mentality of simplistic innocence. When speaking his opinion, he struggles to articulate himself with Charlie Brown-like stammering and wishy-washiness. For this reason, people consider him an idiot, but he is a good, honest, sympathetic, and gracious person.

But the term "idiot" has also its esoteric meaning as used by [[George Gurdjieff]]; from William Patrick Patterson's _Struggle of the Magicians_, p. 153-154:

> Gurdjieff sits on the terrace of the Café Henri IV drinking coffee and cognac and working on a translation of All and Everything when the writer Thornton Wilder is introduced to him. Gurdjieff grunts and motions him to sit down and have a coffee and cognac. Asking Wilder a number of questions, he laughs inordinately at every reply.
> 
> Wilder is not put off. He sees in Gurdjieff's face someone who is "at once sly and jovial, arrogant and clownish." He looked, says Wilder, "like a very intelligent Armenian rug-dealer."
> 
> Gurdjieff orders more coffee and cognac and tells Wilder, "In the world, everybody idiot. Twenty-one kinds of idiot: simple idiot, ambitious idiot, compassionate idiot, objective idiot, subjective idiot-everybody one kind of idiot."
> 
> Wilder tells him he thinks he is a subjective idiot.
> 
> "Non," answers Gurdjieff, laughing uproariously. "Il ne faut pas aller trop vite. Il faut chercher.-Mais vous êtes idiot type vingt: vous êtes idiot sans espoir!" (No. One mustn't go too fast. One must search.-But you are idiot type twenty: you are idiot without hope.).
> 
> Wilder is not offended and Gurdjieff asks him to come to dinner at the Prieuré. Says Wilder: "I had begun to like him, and his eyes rested on me affectionately."
> 
> Gurdjieff holds his glass toward Wilder and says-barely able to speak for laughter: "I idiot, too. Everybody idiot. I idiot vingt-et-un (twentyone). I"--Gurdjieff holds his forefinger emphatically pointed skyward -- "I the unique idiot." And he breaks into convulsions of laughter.
