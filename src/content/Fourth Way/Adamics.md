In [[Boris Mouravieff]]'s [[Gnosis (book trilogy)|_Gnosis_ books]], **adamic man** refers to a human being who has an individuated [[Soul|soul]]. Such a person possesses, at least in potential, the so-called [[Higher centers|higher emotional and higher intellectual centers]]. Esoteric work is possible and meaningful for the Adamic man.

The word Adamic refers to the story of the [[Fall from Eden]]. Adamic man has known an Edenic state in the past and carries a vague racial recollection of such a golden age, at least unconsciously. This can translate into a quest for spiritual meaning. The Adamic man's spiritual quest is symbolized by the Biblical parable of the prodigal son, where the far country corresponds to the present Earth.

Adamic and [[pre-Adamic man]] are substantially indistinguishable from each other in normal circumstances. Genetic mixing has made it so that either type can occur in the same family.

In Book III of _Gnosis_, Mouravieff discusses what he calls "pre-adamic humanity" and "adamic humanity." Here are some excerpts of what Mouravieff has to say:

> In the first volume of _Gnosis_, we already referred several times to the coexistence of two essentially different races: one of Men, and another of Anthropoids. We must emphasize the fact that from the esoteric point of view the latter term has no derogatory meaning.…The Scriptures contain more than one reference to the coexistence on our planet of these two humanities - which are now alike in form but unlike in essence. We can even say that the whole dramatic history of humanity, from the fall of Adam until today, not excluding the prospect of the new era, is overshadowed by the coexistence of these two human races whose separation will occur only at the Last Judgement. (p. 107)
> 
> …The human tares, the anthropoid race, are the descendants of pre-adamic humanity. The principal difference between contemporary pre-adamic man and adamic man - a difference which is not perceived by the senses - is that the former does not possess the developed [[higher centres]] that exist in the latter which, although they have been cut off from his waking [[Consciousness|consciousness]] since the Fall, offer him a real possibility of esoteric evolution. Apart from this, the two races are similar: they have the same lower centres, the same structure of the Personality and the same physical body, although more often than not this is stronger in the pre-adamic man than in the adamic; regarding beauty, we must not forget that pre-adamic man and woman were created by [[God]] on the sixth day, in His image and after His likeness, and that the daughters of this race were beautiful. (pp. 108-109)
> 
> By identifying himself with the ‘I' of his [[Personality (Fourth Way)|Personality]], Adam lost consciousness of his [[Real I|real ‘I']] and fell from the Eden that was his original condition into the same condition as the pre-adamics… The two humanities, coming from two different creative processes, later mingled on the level of organic life on Earth… From then on, the coexistence of these two human types, and the competition which was the result of this, became the norm…we can see that throughout the centuries, even in our own day, adamics in their post-fall condition, have been are are generally in an inferior position to the pre-adamics.…For the moment we will restrict ourselves to repeating that contemporary adamic man, having lost contact with his higher centres and therefore with his real ‘I', appears practically the same as his pre-adamic counterpart. However, unlike the latter, he still has his higher centres, which ensure that he has the possibility of following the way of esoteric evolution. At present, pre-adamic man is deprived of this possibility, but it will be given to him if adamic humanity develops as it should during the era of the Holy Spirit. (p. 129)
