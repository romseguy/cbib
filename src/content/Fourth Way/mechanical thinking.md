The formatory apparatus is Ouspensky's term for the mechanical aspect of the lower intellectual center.

The natural function of this center is storage of information and its associative retrieval. The term "formatory thinking" Is used when this function replaces the less mechanical aspects of thinking. Formatory thinking is characterized by insensitivity to context, black and white statements or strictly agreeing or disagreeing. Repeating by rote and not taking specific circumstance into account are the main characteristics of formatory thinking.

Mouravieff states the the human intellect is blind to the 'third force.' This is specially true of formatory thinking.
