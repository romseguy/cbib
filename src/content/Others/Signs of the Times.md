**Signs of the Times** (Sott.net) is an alternative news website, originally founded on March 26, 2002 by [[Laura Knight-Jadczyk]]. It both produces its own articles and videos and aggregates and comments on information from elsewhere on the web.

SOTT is a research project of the non-profit [[Quantum Future Group]] (QFG) and is run by volunteers. The project includes collecting, arranging, and analyzing news items that seem to best reflect the movement of macrocosmic quantum energies on the planet. This research further includes noting whether or not human beings, individually and/or collectively, can actually remember from one day to the next the state of the planet, and whether they are able to accurately read that information and make intelligent decisions about their future based on that knowledge. In short, SOTT is an experiment.

While the site began as a one-woman operation, this work quickly attracted some truly fine, open minds – people interested in truth, many of whom are scientific professionals and whose work on SOTT is anonymous for their own protection. SOTT and QFG has been attacked, suppressed, and marginalized by the [[Matrix control system|Powers That Be]] in ways that no other work has been, leaving editors and researchers with the distinct impression that they must be on the right track.

SOTT is comprised of an international body of over hundred volunteer editors, including many leading-edge professionals in the so-called hard sciences, medicine, history, sociology, psychology, engineering, and information technology. Whatever the topic, Sott.net has an expert (or several) who handles content in that particular field.

The _raison d'être_ for SOTT's fully reproduced non-original content collection is something that makes it a bit different. It is noticed that a lot of material disappears from the web, and SOTT stores full articles from elsewhere in its database for a particular purpose: analyzing the "energetic flows", for example the overall agendas and trends in geopolitics.
