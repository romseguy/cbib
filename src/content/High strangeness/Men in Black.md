"**Men in Black**" (MIB) refers to a kind of strange visitor encountered in connection with the [[UFO phenomenon]]. They have been reported to visit [[Alien abduction|UFO abductees]] in order to scare them to keep their experience to themselves. They are generally described as expressionless and mechanical, not quite alive. They drive big black cars, wear black suits and sometimes have been seen to disappear in thin air or walk into a light and disappear. They are like a poor synthetic imitation of a human.

According to the [[Cassiopaeans]], the MIB's are semi-physical projections of [[Fourth density service to self being|fourth density service to self beings]].
