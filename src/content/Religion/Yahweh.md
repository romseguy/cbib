This name "**Yahweh**" is often said to mean "I Am", or "I am that which I Am". This refers to the God of the Old Testament. Alternate names are YHWH or Tetragrammaton.

The launching of widespread [[Monotheism|monotheism]] which endures to this day through the agency of Yahweh and his prophets is among the most influential actions of the 'control system'. The memes launched in the name of Yahweh and recorded in the Old Testament are the bane of man to this day.

What Yahweh precisely was or was not is difficult to say. From the Old Testament accounts, one could surmise this was a non-human entity or group with at least [[Fourth density|partly physical existence]] and the ability to alter perceptions, a bit like is reported in conjunction with the modern [[UFO phenomenon]]. The approach, claims, and language, not to mention the fruits, suggest a [[Fourth density service to self being|negative entity]].
