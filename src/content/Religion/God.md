In the present work, we use **God** with a capital G to refer to a universal source of all which is. Other expressions to the effect include the One, prime creator, seventh density (used by [[Ra]] and the [[Cassiopaeans]]), and Sun Absolute (used by [[George Gurdjieff]]).

God is and is not distinct from creation. God is a prerequisite of creation and creation is a prerequisite of God's self-knowledge. Theologians have speculated on the possibility of something existing outside God. German mystic Jacob Boehme speaks of the ungrund, a sort of primal field of all potentialities which is the source of creation. This ungrund is not however the same as God. In more modern terms, we could say the ungrund is the zero point field and God is the consciousness which mediates between this and the emergence of all which is, energy as well as matter. Nicolai Berdayev proposes that the ungrund is in fact the primordial freedom, which is then brought to form by creation. Thus freedom is in a sense more fundamental than God. This is close to the Cassiopaea/Ra idea of free will as the primary principle of the universe. We probably cannot speak of causal order of precedence at this level and must posit freedom and will, as well as the first duality of being and non-being as simultaneously arising.

The Christian idea of the three hypostates of Father, Son and the Holy Spirit is reconciled with the idea of a single source by Mouravieff where he ties these to the different cosmoses of the 4th Way cosmology.

The Sufis have an idea of God and creation that largely parallels the [[Fourth Way|4th Way]] ray of creation. God is one but becomes manifested in an increasing variety of forms as one goes from the spiritual towards the material. Along this descent are found the diverse names or faces of God, from the severe to the forgiving, from the fair to the tyrannical, from destructive to creating.

Hinduism has the concept of Brahman which roughly corresponds to a one source of all universes. The first division is symbolized by the triad of Brahma the creator, Shiva the destroyer, Vishnu the maintainer.
