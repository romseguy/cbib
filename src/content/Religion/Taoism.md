As an alternative to the eastern (Chinese) tradition to Confucianism, Taoism, or "The Way", is a philosophy based on living according to nature's laws.

To act in favor of Tao is to act by _wu wei_ or "let nature take its course".

Likewise, one would live and act by flowing with the river, as opposed to building dams and impediments. A Taoist lives without regret, aware of the present, thoughtful of the past and enamored with faith for the future. Key principles include abandonment of self-interest and expectations of the future.
