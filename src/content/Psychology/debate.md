"**Debate**" and "**discuss**" are often designated as synonyms in dictionaries. However, on examining the roots of both, the two words reveal very distinct and different natures. Debate is formed from the root _battre_ – to beat. Discuss comes from _discutere_ – to break apart – or _disquatere_ – to shake.

Debate carries the connotation of arguing something in which one has a vested interest, and the importance is placed on winning the point and beating the opponent. To discuss, however, is a closer examination of the subject and incorporates differences of opinion. It is to take the data apart, scrutinize the facts and shake up conventional beliefs.
