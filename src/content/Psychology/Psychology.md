**Psychology** studies how individuals and groups function, in terms of mind, emotion, behavior, interaction and relationships, brain functions, etc. It is essential to understanding ourselves and others, and in turn how we can work on ourselves, how best to accomplish goals, and how to work well with others and help one another.

Knowing oneself and others
--------------------------

We live in a rather sick civilization – one in which [the most pathological people are in power]([[Ponerology]]). The mental, emotional, and social functioning of people in general reflects this. Society is [[Narcissism|narcissistic]], and almost everyone has been subject to some degree of narcissistic wounding.

In trying to understand ourselves and the world, a major problem is that we don't really know ourselves, and our capacity to do so is limited. Findings of cognitive and social psychology make clear that our thinking, attitudes, and behavior is largely ruled by unconscious brain mechanisms, some of which we are born with, while other aspects are programmed in large part by early experiences and thereafter direct our lives according to rigid pattern-matching.

The study of the brain and nervous system, its various components and how they work together, fills in important parts of the overall picture – the most important of which is how we can change our brains and in turn our lives.

In relation to the Fourth Way
-----------------------------

In modern psychological and neuroscientific research – particularly of the cognitive, social, affective, and behavioral paradigms – discoveries sometimes echo key concepts of [[George Gurdjieff]]'s [[Fourth Way]] teaching. Said teaching forms a practical framework for work on oneself, and both theoretical and practical understanding thereof is furthered by the discoveries of modern science. This approach of combining the scientific and the esoteric is part and parcel of the [[Cassiopaean Experiment]], its "philosophy", and the wider research connected to it.

The mind-body connection
------------------------

Bodily health affects one's mind and behavior, and emotional health and interpersonal dynamics affect bodily health. As such, the study of [[Health and wellness|health topics]] along with psychology is essential to a more complete and practical understanding.

### Cassiopaea Forum

*   [The Adaptive Unconscious](https://cassiopaea.org/forum/index.php/topic,26247.0.html) (The first posts of this thread contain excerpts from Timothy D. Wilson's book _Strangers to Ourselves_, which explores the subject of the adaptive unconscious and its role in our lives. These findings make clear how we don't know ourselves. As discussed in the thread, they are an example of how modern cognitive and social psychology have disocvered things which parallel Gurdjieff's Fourth Way teachings.)
*   [Fear Of The Abyss - Aleta Edwards](https://cassiopaea.org/forum/index.php/topic,28420.0.html) (A description, with quotes, of a book which can be very useful for those with a particular kind of personality which seems to be fairly common among us. "PCS people" have among their typical traits perfectionism, control issues, and shame – as well as black and white thinking, trouble with making decisions, fear of disappointment or of dissapointing others, and some other characteristics. Underlying all this is a fear, unconsciously hidden from, of the self – of who and what one is. Throughout the thread, people discuss their experiences and realizations as they work through the material in the book.)

Levine's book _In An Unspoken Voice: How the Body Releases Trauma and Restores Goodness_, with quotes. This book covers the physiological basis of trauma and a body-centered method of recovery. The theory is based on neuroscience and behavioral studies, and the practice (called Somatic Experiencing) on clinical experience. Some discussion follows.)

Levine PhD](http://www.youtube.com/watch?feature=player_embedded&v=ByalBx85iC8) (Levine uses his famous "Slinky" presentation to demonstrate the effects of trauma on the nervous system, and his philosophy of treating trauma. This philosophy involves slowly releasing (or titrating) compressed fight-or-flight energy a bit at time to give the individual the ability to reintegrate it back into their nervous system.)

All ‘Psychology’ topics

*   [[Archetype]] (Generally, a universal idea or exemplar of a principle. The word is used in metaphysics, psychology, study of myths, and other fields.)
*   [[Assumption]] (Assumptions are ideas, value judgements or unquestioned premises which color one's thinking, generally without one's own awareness.)
*   [[Belief vs. faith]] (In FOTCM discourse, the term belief means a concept which is accepted as a given truth, without necessarily being critically evaluated. 'Belief' often connotates emotional attachment of the believer to the belief. By contrast, the term faith can connote an open-minded attitude and trust in the process of inquiry.)
*   [[Brain]] (The brain plays a role in mediating between the physical world and consciousness.)
*   [[Cognitive dissonance]] (A ubiquitous condition to which the human is so inured to that most of it even goes unnoticed.)
*   [[Conscience]] (The awareness of a moral or ethical aspect to one's conduct together with the urge to prefer right over wrong: Let your conscience be your guide.)
*   [[Consciousness]] (Everything is really a form of consciousness, from its formless higher transcendental aspects to it's lower derivatives that take an innumerable number of different forms.)
*   [[Dark Man' dream|"Dark Man" dream]] (A dream experience where a dark predator is present in one's environment and a warning that it is about to rob the dreamer of something precious.)

*   [[Emotional hook]] (The term refers to manipulating a person by appealing to some known aspect of personality with the intent of getting something for the self.)
*   [[Empathy]] (Empathy is being conscious of, or sensitive to, the emotions of another person or group of people.)
*   [[Essence]] (In Fourth Way discourse, a man's essence is the totality of the qualities or propensities he is born with. As opposed to this, personality is the totality of the acquired or learned patterns of thought, emotion, and behavior. In modern psychology, inherited characteristics also play a large role.)
*   [[Feminine vampire]] (This term refers to a special type of human predator who plays a game involving appeal to the rescuer or protector programs of others, playing the victim, playing on others' guilt and self-importance and other techniques of manipulation.)
*   [[Greenbaum]] (A code word for a technique of mind control.)
*   [[Hypnosis]] (The conscious mind is put to sleep leaving the subconscious open to suggestion and receptive to commands.)
*   [[Idiot]] (In general usage, a foolish or stupid person, but the term "idiot" has also its esoteric meaning as used by George Gurdjieff.)
*   [[Imprinting]] (Psychology speaks of periods of imprint sensitivity in the context of an infant's or young child's early development.)
*   [[Intuition]] (To grasp something intuitively is to acquire an idea without the use of reasoning.)

*   [[Psychic vampirism]] (Encompasses both psychological manipulation and a sort of psychic game of dominance and exploitation.)
*   [[Psychopathy]] (This personality disorder is puzzling and intractable. Its principal feature seems to be a lack of conscience.)
*   [[Psychopathy (ponerology)]] (Psychopathy was once used to refer to any mental disorder, but in its modern meaning is a psychological construct that describes chronic immoral and antisocial behavior. A psychopath is conscienceless, and, most importantly, this is hidden from view behind a mask of normality that is often so convincing that even experts reportedly are deceived.)
*   [[Reaction machine]] (The term reaction machine is sometimes used to describe man's mechanical nature. This applies to common man in general but especially to the organic portal or Pre-Adamic man and even more to the psychopath.)

*   [[Wishful thinking]] (Wishful thinking is a fundamental property of the service to self orientation.)
*   [[Word salad]] (A term that refers to an unintelligible mixture of random words and/or phrases.)
*   [[Yes, but]] (These words are often a tell-tale sign of self-justification and rationalization. When applied to oneself, repeated use of "yes, but" will create a self-tranquillizing mechanism. Lying to oneself dulls one's ability to discern truth, which is the very thing esoteric work seeks to develop.)
