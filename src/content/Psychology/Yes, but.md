The words **"yes, but"** are often a tell-tale sign of self-justification and rationalization. In itself, there's nothing wrong with using these words in discussion; but when applied to oneself, repeated use of "yes, but" will create a self-tranquillizing mechanism which is esoterically harmful. [[Lies and lying|Lying]] to oneself dulls one's ability to discern [[Truth|truth]], which is the very thing esoteric work seeks to develop.

Simple examples of "yes, but" are:

*   "Yes, I was used and then abandoned, but I was in love."
*   "Yes, I sinned, but doesn't one need to know sin in order to better avoid it?"

The possible variations of "yes, but" are endless. What these have in common is diffusing a [[Shock (Fourth Way)|shock]] by attaching some agreeable or seemingly reasonable explanation to something that would normally shock one. It is one example of what is called [[Self-calming|self-calming]].

A more fruitful way of describing the situations in the above examples would be to say:

*   "I preferred basking in the subjective feeling of being in love to acting on the objective fact of being taken advantage of."
*   "I put my conscience to sleep with the pretext of gaining knowledge when in fact I was interested in indulging in whatever for my subjective pleasure."

At least, these latter formulations acknowledge that the [[Predator's mind|inner "predator"]], or [[Service to others and service to self|self-serving]] or [[Subjectivity|subjective]] part of the self was running the show. In real situations, however, lies to the self can be much more complex.
