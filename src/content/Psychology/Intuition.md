To grasp something intuitively is to acquire an idea without the use of reasoning.

Intuition is a said to be a faculty that allows for almost immediate insight into a situation, person or concept. Intuition usually takes the form of a feeling or impression. Mathematicians, for instance, are purported to frequently intuit that their theorem is correct, before being able to display proof. Being nebulous in character, it is perhaps a mechanism that guides inspiration and questioning by alerting the mind that there is something to discover. Then departs, leaving it to the faculties of reason and the senses of observation to determine the truth of it.

"The intellect has little to do on the road to discovery. There comes a leap in consciousness, call it intuition or what you will, the solution comes to you and you don't know how or why. The truly valuable thing is the intuition. "

\- Albert Einstein
