**Word salad** is a term that refers to random words and/or phrases linked together in an unintelligible manner, where a listener/reader would be unable to understand it. Psychologically, this term is commonly used to describe a symptom of a neurological/mental disorder, such as schizophrenia.

Word salad is often used in New Age materials where many "New Age gurus" use the words without any comprehension or deeper meanings of the subjects being discussed.
