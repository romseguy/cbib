The term refers to manipulating a person by appealing to some known aspect of personality with the intent of getting something for the self. The transaction can be very subtle and what is received can be abstract, like a sense of power or of being in control.

Pity is often used for such purposes. The manipulator appeals to another's sense of compassion in order to establish a potentially lengthy feeding dynamic.
