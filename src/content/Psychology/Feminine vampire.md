This term refers to a special type of human predator who plays a game involving appeal to the rescuer or protector programs of others, playing the victim, playing on others' guilt and self-importance and other techniques of manipulation. The feminine vampire is often female but does not have to be.

There is much possible variation of style and degree within this archetype, but a few of the below behaviors and effects are likely to be present:

*   **Feigned helplessness** - The feminine vampire seeks to project an image of general helplessness or fragility. The vampire makes a big point of having had a miserable life, of suffering, of being treated badly or neglected etc. This justifies demanding compensation for supposed wrongs from the whole world.

*   **No amount of effort makes a difference** - No matter what anyone says or does for the vampire, the situation does not improve. The vampire remains in need and miserable and in fact desires nothing but to keep on feeding.

*   **Playing on guilt** - The vampire likes to accuse others of heartlessness while in effect caring for none but the self. Projecting one's own actions on others is a common trait of a predator. This is understandable since the predator hardly knows of non-predatory ways or at least sees no point in these. Thus the projecting of these on others comes naturally. This projecting can also feed a lie to self concerning the self's supposed specialness or moral virtue.

*   **Feigned higher aspirations and hypocrisy** - The feminine vampire may make a great show of compassion, standing up for the oppressed and so forth. Only nothing concrete ever comes out of this because the predator is only interested in self-image, not in action to benefit others. There are multitudinous rationalizations for lack of action, preferably blaming this on others. For example, nothing can be done due to lack of assistance, being misunderstood, abused and so forth.

*   **Seduction** - In some cases the feminine vampire will play on sexual interests or tensions. The vampire does not have to be concupiscent, however. Ones who will go on wild flings, engage in reckless affairs and fatal passions, monomanic preoccupations with supposedly perfect loves, battles for control over the target's heart, represent a somewhat different flavor of predator. A certain frenzy may be typical of the vampire but it does not have to be explicitly sexual.

Variations on the theme are so numerous that it is somewhat pointless to attempt to enumerate them all.
