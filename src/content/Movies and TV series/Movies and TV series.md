A number of movies on different topics – fiction and non-fiction alike – have been discussed on the [Cassiopaea Forum](https://cassiopaea.org/forum/index.php). Some are recommended, as they convey useful information or give perspective – whether on a particular topic or regarding life in a broader sense. Occasionally, a TV series may also fall into this category. The ones described on this wiki are listed on this page.
