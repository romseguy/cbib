**Operation Paperclip** was an Office of Strategic Services (OSS) program, implemented in the aftermath of World War II, the goal of which was to locate and secretly import over 1,500 former Nazi scientists and engineers (from Nazi Germany and other foreign countries) into the United States.

These were variously employed in staffing the Central Intelligence Agency (CIA), in the NASA space program and other activities, such as mind control research.
