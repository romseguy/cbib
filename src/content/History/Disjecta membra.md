The term **disjecta membra** is used to refer to fragments of a formerly whole body of [[Knowledge|knowledge]] which has been scattered into often hard to recognize bits and pieces over time, by the process of transmission or through deliberate obfuscation. (In Latin, it means "disjoint or scattered members or parts".) In this state the original meanings and context have been lost.

For example, the elements of the [[Grail]] ensemble, such as the sword, the cup and lance may be _disjecta membra_ of ancient science or technology. The legends may be _disjecta membra_ of formerly known esoteric practices and archetypes of spiritual evolution.
