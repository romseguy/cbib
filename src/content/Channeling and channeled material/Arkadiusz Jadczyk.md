Arkadiusz Jadczyk is a theoretical physicist and husband of [[Laura Knight-Jadczyk]].

Professor Jadczyk is fascinated by the problems of the foundations of [[Quantum physics|quantum theory]], and its relation to the philosophy of science and theories of knowledge, consciousness and mind.

With Philip Blanchard, he developed [[Event Enhanced Quantum Theory]] (EEQT), which is an attempt at bridging between the quantum and classical worlds in physics; additional material and papers are available at [Quantum Future website](http://www.quantumfuture.net/).

In the past, he has worked on algebraic methods and the foundations of quantum theory, differential geometric methods of field theory, theories of gravitation, Kaluza-Klein theories of hidden dimensions, and supersymmetry, non-commutative geometry, fractals.
