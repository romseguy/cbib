Channeled by Barbara Marciniak in the New Age classic, _[[Bringers of the Dawn]]_, the **Pleiadians** present themselves as a group entity from the far future.

The book is addressed as a wake-up call to supposed "[[Wanderer|wanderers]]", or "system busters" who have incarnated on Earth at this time to assist with the events of [[The Wave|the Wave]]. The book is engaging but, according to the [[FOTCM|FOTCM]] take on the matter, it is a mixed source with genuine higher density information blended with the channel's preconceptions and a heavy dose of "[[You create your own reality|you create your own reality]]".

The term "lizzie" was first introduced in _Bringers of the Dawn_ as a name for the [[Fourth density service to self being|4th density STS overlords]] keeping humanity captive. The book agrees in many key points with Cassiopaea and Ra and is a good read if one does not take everything too literally. Marciniak's later work is, in the [[FOTCM|FOTCM]] view, rather more STS-influenced and ritualistic, thus _Bringers of the Dawn_ remains her best work.

The Cassiopaeans have said that Ra and the Pleiadians are their "colleagues", occupying a somewhat different point of focus in sixth density but with access to essentially the same understandings. Differences in the channel and audience can account for many differences of focus and tone.
