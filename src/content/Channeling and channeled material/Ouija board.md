**Ouija board**, also known as a spirit board, is a flat board (wooden or otherwise) marked with letters and numbers along with various symbols. It uses a planchette as a moving indicator for the spirit or an entity to move by spelling its messages out on the board during a _s√©ance_ or a session. Participants place their fingers on the planchette and it would be moved around the board to spell out the words.

The use of Ouija board was popular during the 19th century, particularly in the Spiritualism movement. The board was popularized as a dangerous tool and misunderstood in the 1973 horror film, _The Exorcist_, where a young character was possessed by an entity from using the board.

The board is not limited to a simple lettering, such as ABC, numbers, "yes", "no", "goodbye" as shown on the Ouija board. It can be marked with multiple symbols and graphics, making it easier for the unseen source to use.

[[Laura Knight-Jadczyk]] used a board called "Psychic Circle", along with her own letterings added to it, to channel the [[Cassiopaeans]].
