In general usage, Ra is the ancient Egyptian solar deity.

In the present context, Ra refers to the channeled entity of the _Law of One_ books, channeled by Don Elkins, Carla Rueckert and Jim Mc Carthy in 1981-84. The material was suggested by the Cassiopaeans as a primer for the Cassiopaea information. The Ra material's greatest usefulness is in giving general definitions to the concepts of density, service to self vs service to others, free will and presenting a general cosmology.

We often quote Ra in the present work for definitions having to do with higher densities, the polarity of STO and STS and other more metaphysical matters.

Chakras and other aspects of the human being are discussed but [[FOTCM|FOTCM]] generally finds the [[Fourth Way|4th Way]] concepts to be clearer and better applicable to modern humanity. The Ra material may have suffered from a bias to predominantly see the good in things, although the long-term infringement of human free will by 4th density STS forces is also discussed.

More commentary is available in the [_Wave_ series](http://cassiopaea.org/2010/05/08/the-wave-chapter-1-riding-the-wave/). The material itself is available at [L/L Research](http://www.llresearch.org/).
