**Poltergeist** is a term that usually means a "noisy ghost" that was responsible for any physical disturbances, such as objects being moved around and loud noises. The word comes from German words _poltern_ (rattle, to make noise) and _geist_ (ghost or spirit).

Many years of investigations and researches into the poltergeist phenomenon points to the fact that such activity may not have anything to do with so-called "earthbound ghosts" or spirits, but centers around an individual's subconscious mind under emotional/psychological stress. The activity is similar to psychokinetic.

Nandor Fodor pointed out that poltergeists are manifestations of conflicts within the subconscious mind of an individual under some type of emotional or physical stress.

Gef the Talking Mongoose (1931) and Tina Resch (1984) are two of the famous poltergeist cases investigated.
