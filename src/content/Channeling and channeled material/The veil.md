In the [[Ra]] material, **the veil** denotes that which separates man's conscious from the [subconscious]([[Subconscious]]). In specific, this includes the relative lack of access to past life memories.

The veil, as Ra puts it, intensifies polarization in [[Third density|third density]]. In other words, having to act based on ambiguous data and without the benefit of lifetimes of experience of direct sight into the metaphysical orientation of others strengthens the [[Soul|soul]]. If all were seen, one would not act on faith and develop the internal consistency and commitment needed for this. Knowledge acquired through deciphering the world seen through a veil and acting on this inherently uncertain data is more valuable in soul terms than knowledge which is simply read, as from an open book.
