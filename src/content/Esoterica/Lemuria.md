This is the name of a mythical continent, usually placed in the Southern Pacific.

Like Atlantis, the continent is said to be long sunk, with possibly Hawaii and Easter Islands being former mountain peaks still above water. Generally, Lemuria is dated before the epoch of the Atlantean culture.

Diverse channeled sources give varying descriptions of Lemuria. While we have Plato's original account of Atlantis, there is no similar original story of Lemuria. It is most difficult to know anything certain about the subject.
