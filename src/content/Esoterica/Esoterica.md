Esoteric matters that don't fit specifically into any of the other main topics.

All ‘Esoterica’ topics
----------------------

*   [[Akashic records]] (A sort of cosmic memory of all which has been.)
*   [[Alchemical terminology]] (Alchemists hid their esoteric work under various obscure terms and expressions due to some zealous persecution and a little jealous secrecy over the ages.)
*   [[Alchemy]] (Defined as an allegorical description of the human chemical factory and it's work in transforming coarse substances (base metals) into finer ones (precious ones))
*   [[Atom (esoteric definition)]] (Esotericism views the atom, and matter that is built up from the aggregation of these atoms in a much more encompassing way then does material science.)
*   [[Bodies of man]] (Whether man possesses so-called higher bodies from birth varies from teaching to teaching. For example, theosophy and anthroposophy teach that such exist, whereas George Gurdjieff says they must be created through esoteric work. We can bridge between Gurdjieff and Rudolf Steiner by the system of seven bodies presented by Mark Hedsel.)
*   [[Cabala vs. Kabbalah]] (The difference between cabala and kabbalah.)
*   [[Cataclysm]] (Cataclysms occur at very different scales.)

*   [[Death]] (Death is the center of a vast network of symbols.)
*   [[Depression]] (When one becomes dissatisfied with the stock answers given by religion, culture and science and begins to look elsewhere for truth, the resulting shocks of learning the true nature of our reality can be truly depressing.)
*   [[Energy]] (In physics, energy means capacity to do work.)

*   [[Esoteric Christianity]] (A term used to refer to the Fourth Way teachings.)
*   [[Fall of man]] (The idea of some past catastrophic event for humanity is nearly ubiquitous in myth and religion.)
*   [[Food for the Moon]] (An allegory that the Moon feeds on organic life, on humanity. In this sense, humanity is food for the Moon.)
*   [[Gnosis]] (Means knowledge, mostly used when speaking of esoteric matters.)
*   [[Green Language]] (Green Language, or the "language of the birds", refers to the generally opaque and confusing way the few texts there are are written.)
*   [[Group transduction of energy]] (Groups of people represent different spiritual principles at different times.)
