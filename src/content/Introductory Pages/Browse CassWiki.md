This page provides several options for browsing among all the contents of **CassWiki**: lists of topics, as well as the categories of the wiki. If you'd like to begin with a quick introduction to some key subjects, see [[CassWiki Reader's guide|CassWiki:Reader's guide]].

Main topics
-----------

Below are the main topics of the wiki. From each of them, you can in turn reach its subtopics.

*   [[Abbreviations]] (Abbreviations commonly used in online discussion, either on the Internet at large, or more particularly by the [[FOTCM|FOTCM]] and related groups. Some of them may appear in article text, or in quoted content included in them.)
*   [[Books]] (Books on different topics, and recommended reading.)
*   [[Cassiopaean Experiment]] (The name coined for Laura Knight-Jadczyk's experiment with critical channeling. The channeled material which this experiment has led to is used as a source of inspiration for research, and the larger process of inquiry is inseparable from the Cassiopaean Experiment.)
*   [[Channeling and channeled material]] (To channel is to serve as a medium through which an entity communicates with living persons. Some channeled material can be verified to be true, but most can not – and plenty can be verified to be either false or meaningless word salad. The best channeled material can give valuable inspiration for critical-minded research – while most of it can grossly mislead. There are many concepts conveyed through channeling to examine.)
*   [[Esoterica]] (Esoteric matters that don't fit specifically into any of the other main topics.)
*   [[Fourth Way]] (A body of teaching on the possible spiritual development of man, introduced to the Western culture by George Ivanovitch Gurdjieff in the first half of the 20th century.)
*   [[Health and wellness]] (The state of our body not only affects our physical capabilities, but also our emotional health and intellectual ability; and conversely, our emotional health affects our physical health along with our thinking. This is one of the most important topics for anyone seeking to work on him- or herself or to be healthy and well in our all too sick world.)
*   [[High strangeness]] (High strangeness refers to a global phenomenon so strange and foreign to our daily terrestrial mode of thought, which it carries with it many implications of the existence of intelligences other than our own.)
*   [[History]]
*   [[Matrix control system]] (A metaphorical description of present day Earth reality, by analogy with several concepts from the 1999 movie hit _The Matrix_.)
*   [[Movies and TV series]] (Movies – fiction and non-fiction alike – on different topics, and recommended watching. Occasionally, a TV series may also fall into this category.)
*   [[Mythology]]
*   [[Natural science]]
*   [[New Age]] (In popular usage, New Age refers to a whole suite of spiritual or religious beliefs, in large part revived from prior tradition or in some cases based on new channeled information from a multiplicity of sources. The New Age is like a supermarket of spirituality geared towards subjectivity,)
*   [[Politics and pathocracy]] (The entire Western world, and its sphere of influence as extended through globalization, comprise a pathocracy. That is, psychopaths are in positions of power, and politics is almost entirely a managed show where nothing of large-scale importance is decided by the people.)
*   [[Ponerology and psychopathy]] (Ponerology is the scientific study of evil and its genesis, and its most important finding is that psychopaths play a main role in causing the suffering and inhumanity seen in the world at present and throughout history. Psychopaths lack empathy and conscience and the ability to ever develop them. Often charming and convincing, they act as intraspecies predators – preying on others in the interest of their own greed for power, status, money, and pleasure.)
*   [[Psychology]] (The study of how individuals and groups function, in terms of mind, emotion, behavior, interaction and relationships, brain functions, etc. It is essential to understanding ourselves and others, and how best to achieve what we value.)
*   [[Religion]]
*   [[Shamanism and archaic esotericism]]

*   [[All is one]] (The Cassiopaeans and many other channeled sources state that 'all is one and one is all.' This idea is also found in various religious writing. The idea is however sometimes naively applied to matters at the human level of experience. The New Age approach of trying to 'see all as one' in order to influence reality is a case in point.)
*   [[All to those who ask]] (A service to others being gives all to those who ask. This leads to the question of what is meant by giving and by asking and who truly are the parties of the exchange.)
*   [[Analogy of the coach]] (The horse-drawn coach is used as a metaphor for the human being.)
*   [[Angel]] (The term angel is used in a wide variety of meanings in different contexts. Generally the term means a spiritual, non-physical being that belongs to some spiritual hierarchy or performs some specific function for a higher spiritual authority such as God. An angel is generally understood as being benevolent.)
*   [[Anticipation and non-anticipation]] (The Cassiopaean material discusses anticipation in relation to following one's path or interacting with reality at large. There two sides to the discussion: the first is that one should always anticipate attack in order to avoid problems by preparation; the second is that one should not be fixated on any particular imagined outcome of one's creative efforts or intent, because such fixation or anticipation restricts the 'creative flow.')
*   [[Antimatter]] (Antimatter is material composed of elementary particles of equal mass but opposite electrical charge.)
*   [[Antimatter universe]] (This universe is said to interact with the matter universe through gravity.)

*   [[Atom (esoteric definition)]] (Esotericism views the atom, and matter that is built up from the aggregation of these atoms in a much more encompassing way then does material science.)
*   [[Attack]] (This denote action of the General Law towards hampering a person's or group's esoteric work or development.)

*   [[Being mentation]] (Refers to thinking beyond the passive associative mechanism of the brain by the effort of the will.)
*   [[Being vs. non-being]] (Depending on the context and level, the reflection of these absolutes can be called service to others/service to self, creation/entropy, order/chaos, spirit/matter, consciousness/sleep.)
*   [[Belief vs. faith]] (In FOTCM discourse, the term belief means a concept which is accepted as a given truth, without necessarily being critically evaluated. 'Belief' often connotates emotional attachment of the believer to the belief. By contrast, the term faith can connote an open-minded attitude and trust in the process of inquiry.)
*   [[Big Bang]] (Emergence of the entire universe of matter and energy from a primal explosion where a point of infinite density, a so-called singularity, exploded and gave rise to all of what we consider to be the universe.)
*   [[Black hole]] (An object near which the gravity field is so intense that the escape velocity exceeds the velocity of light.)
*   [[Black magnetic center]] (A perversion of the magnetic center, forming through and pulling a man towards a self-serving caricature of genuine esoteric work.)
*   [[Bodies of man]] (Whether man possesses so-called higher bodies from birth varies from teaching to teaching. For example, theosophy and anthroposophy teach that such exist, whereas George Gurdjieff says they must be created through esoteric work. We can bridge between Gurdjieff and Rudolf Steiner by the system of seven bodies presented by Mark Hedsel.)
*   [[Books]] (Books on different topics, and recommended reading.)
*   [[Bose-Einstein condensate]] (A unique state of matter that forms below a critical temperature in which all bosons that comprise the matter fall into the same quantum state.)

*   [[Channeling and channeled material]] (To channel is to serve as a medium through which an entity communicates with living persons. Some channeled material can be verified to be true, but most can not – and plenty can be verified to be either false or meaningless word salad. The best channeled material can give valuable inspiration for critical-minded research – while most of it can grossly mislead. There are many concepts conveyed through channeling to examine.)
*   [[Chaos, creation, and order]] (In the classic Greek cosmogony, the Universe is created from chaos. Chaos, the primal confusion is the raw material and then organization, or logos (an ordering principle) comes about and creates the Universe. This mythic concept can be expressed in the more modern terms of quantum physics.)
*   [[Characteropathy]] (In ponerology, personality disorder that is acquired rather than inherited. Characteropaths play important roles early in the ponerogenic process.)

*   [[Conspiracy theory]] (A label that is usually stamped on inconvenient allegations of dishonesty or fraud by government.)
*   [[Constatation]] (Used in the meaning of a definite result of self-observation.)
*   [[Cosmoses (Fourth Way)]] (The Fourth Way cosmology is based on a scale of seven worlds or cosmoses. This is related to the scale of densities of the Ra and Cassiopaea materials, but each classification has a different emphasis.)
*   [[Covert aggression]] (Avoiding any overt display of aggression while simultaneously intimidating others into giving you what you want is a powerfully manipulative maneuver, which is why covert-aggression is most often the vehicle for interpersonal manipulation.)

*   [[Demiurge]] (Refers to the "malevolent God" of the Old Testament, a fallen angel responsible for material creation.)
*   [[Density]] (In the Cassiopaean and Ra materials, denotes a qualitatively distinct level of being. Each density has its own structure of life forms, modes of perception and interaction, and typical lessons for the consciousnesses residing in it.)
*   [[Depression]] (When one becomes dissatisfied with the stock answers given by religion, culture and science and begins to look elsewhere for truth, the resulting shocks of learning the true nature of our reality can be truly depressing.)
*   [[Dervish]] (A member of Surfism, or a Sufi mystic.)
*   [[Destiny]] (A prearranged life plan, possibly watched over by some higher forces which will make it so the destiny gets fulfilled.)

*   [[Esoteric Christianity]] (A term used to refer to the Fourth Way teachings.)
*   [[Esoterica]] (Esoteric matters that don't fit specifically into any of the other main topics.)
*   [[Essence]] (In Fourth Way discourse, a man's essence is the totality of the qualities or propensities he is born with. As opposed to this, personality is the totality of the acquired or learned patterns of thought, emotion, and behavior. In modern psychology, inherited characteristics also play a large role.)

*   [[External vs. internal considering]] (External considering is the practice of taking others into account when acting, seeing their situation as it is and accordingly making life easy both for oneself and for others. Internal considering is the opposite – acting out of a subjective inner state and view of the situation to which one is attached, with any of a number of consequences.)

##### F

*   [[Fall of man]] (The idea of some past catastrophic event for humanity is nearly ubiquitous in myth and religion.)
*   [[Feminine vampire]] (This term refers to a special type of human predator who plays a game involving appeal to the rescuer or protector programs of others, playing the victim, playing on others' guilt and self-importance and other techniques of manipulation.)
*   [[Fifth density]] (In the scale of densities, the fifth density is a non-physical state of being, where entities who incarnate in the first through fourth densities exist between their incarnations. Fifth density is also referred to as a "recycling zone".)
*   [[First density]] (In the scale of densities, the first density corresponds to inanimate matter and energy. Since the scale of density is principally concerned with how awareness interacts with its environment, we could say that the first density is the raw material on which awareness acts in order to create.)

*   [[Fourth density]] (In the scale of densities, the fourth density is a mode of existence between physical and ethereal. There are many names for and presentations of the concept of graduation to fourth density. Fourth density also appears to be the level at which the higher echelons of the "matrix control system" function, thus its possible existence is important for the study of the deeper nature of the world.)
*   [[Fourth density bleedthrough]] (In the Cassiopaean material, fourth density bleedthrough refers to various anomalous perceptions and effects. The idea is that at certain times and places, the boundary between the third and fourth densities becomes thinner and perceptions and laws of nature become somewhat fluid.)
*   [[Fourth density service to self being]] (The term refers to beings of the density directly above the human level who manipulate humanity and other similar life forms for their own ends. These are the architects and ultimate controllers of the "matrix control system", the "Moon" of Gurdjieff, the "Archons" of darkness of the Gnostics. Most of the UFO phenomenon originates with these forces.)

*   [[Goddess]] (Discussion of how the notion of gender ties in with the divine.)
*   [[Graduation to fourth density]] (There appears to be a certain benchmark that a being must meet in order to pass from third density incarnations to fourth density ones. Additionally, it seems that in some cases this can take place while in the body. This benchmark is variously described but all descriptions raise more questions than they answer. We will look at diverse aspects mentioned by different sources below.)

*   [[Health and wellness]] (The state of our body not only affects our physical capabilities, but also our emotional health and intellectual ability; and conversely, our emotional health affects our physical health along with our thinking. This is one of the most important topics for anyone seeking to work on him- or herself or to be healthy and well in our all too sick world.)
*   [[Heating the crucible]] (Receiving shocks and using these as catalyst for internal change, generally for building cohesion between little 'I's.)
*   [[Hendaye]] (This town in the French Basque region is the site of the "cyclic cross" discussed by Fulcanelli.)

*   [[Lessons]] (The universe is one great school, everything learns, even inanimate matter.)
*   [[Lies and lying]] (Lies are ubiquitous in both the inner and outer life of man. Any work aspiring towards truth needs to deal with this state of matters – which to begin with requires distinguishing between various forms of lying.)
*   [[Linear time]] (The concept of a time dimension which is strictly sequential and only moves forward.)
*   [[Lines of Work]] (In Fourth Way schools, the Work is divided into three distinct lines: the student's work on the self, the work with other students, and work for the school.)
*   [[Little 'I's]] (The Fourth Way teaches that man is a collection of inconsistent habits, programs, or stimulus-response patterns; these rule all kinds of inner and outer behavior, and whichever resulting 'self' is active at the moment calls itself 'I' and sees itself always as the one, same person.)
*   [[Logos]] (Word of God.)
*   [[Love]] (There is a bewildering range of meanings and connotations associated with love. The Cassiopaeans have said that love is light is knowledge.)
*   [[Lucifer]] (Literally means "light bringer". In Christian tradition, this is another name for Satan or the devil.)

##### M

*   [[Magnetic center]] (A function in man which is formed as esoteric work proceeds beyond exterior, sleeping man.)
*   [[Make nice program]] (An automatic behavior tending towards avoiding conflict and making repeated concessions or tolerating consistent ill treatment.)
*   [[Man number 1, 2, and 3]]
*   [[Many-worlds interpretation]] (One interpretation of quantum theory is that each time a measurement is made, all possible outcomes of the measurement occur, each in its own parallel world.)
*   [[Mark of the beast]] (The biblical mention of the mark of the beast and the number 666 has sparked endless speculation and interpretation. One of the more original interpretations is found in the Cassiopaean material.)
