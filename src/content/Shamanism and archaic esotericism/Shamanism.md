**Shamanism** is a common name for native ancient spiritual practices found throughout the world. Shamanism is usually found in a tribal society and is a cultural institution with definite forms and traditions but does not generally have all the formal or ritual baggage of organized religion.

The most authentic survival of shamanism is probably found in Siberia, a living tradition well into the 20th century.

The shaman may have been a woman in the earliest times, although both men and women have performed the function. Generally, the shaman is the spiritual defender of the tribe, a spiritual warrior who defends the integrity of the people against illness and negative spiritual forces. The shaman's function usually combines priest and healer into one. The shaman is often chosen at an early age based on heredity or by a child showing mystical experience or spiritual gifts. The shaman's craft is passed by direct instruction and confirmed by initiation.

Shamanistic practice often includes an idea of the [[Axis mundi|world tree or axis of the world]], bridging between a lower and a higher world from the world of man. Animal spirit guides are often associated with shamanism. The shaman may either descend to the world of the dead or the world of animals or ascend to a realm of gods in a trance state. The trance is sometimes brought about through the use of hallucinogens, but it may also be the result of mental concentration, drumming, and/or other techniques. The shaman contacts the [[Archetype|archetypal]] level in order to effect a cure or bring needed knowledge to the tribe. The shaman's journey is an enactment of the [[Heroic archetype|heroic journey]] into the unknown in order to bring new vitality to the world. The shaman is a sort of living bridge between worlds.

The [[FOTCM|FOTCM]] proposes that some forms of shamanism are the most authentic survival of ancient spiritual practices and knowledge from prehistoric times. Shamanistic practices may record echoes of the megalithic cultures and the times of the [[Goddess|goddess]] worship and the splitting between the [[Circle people vs. pyramid people|circle and pyramid peoples]]. It seems that the psychic powers of the shamans of old have atrophied or much knowledge has been lost. Since shamanism relies on oral transmission and direct instruction, much may indeed be lost. Furthermore, tradition seems to indicate that a specific genetic constitution is needed. The [[FOTCM|FOTCM]]'s research and the [[Cassiopaeans|Cassiopaean]] material indicate that also genetic factors necessary for the shaman's powers may have become very rare or altogether lost. The decline of ancient shamanism started around the time of the introduction of organized religion, around 4000-2000 BCE by mainstream reckoning, although the traditions survived near to our day in isolated parts of the world. It Is possible that shamanism retained fragments of knowledge after the collapse of a previous global civilization such as [[Atlantis]]. This would in part explain the similarities found throughout the world.

Mircea Eliade's book, _[[Shamanism Archaic Techniques of Ecstasy|Shamanism: Archaic Techniques of Ecstasy]]_ is a comprehensive study of shamanism worldwide. [[Laura Knight-Jadczyk]] discusses shamanism extensively in _[[The Wave Series]]_.
