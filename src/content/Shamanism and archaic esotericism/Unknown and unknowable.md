[[Carlos Castaneda|Castaneda]] divides the super-sensible world into the unknown and unknowable. The unknown can, in principle, be known and interaction with it, difficult and frightening as it may be, can be enriching and ultimately invigorating. Cultivating the virtues of the warrior prepares one to face the unknown.

Interaction with the unknowable is simply ill-advised and opens the door to dangerous psychic phenomena, such as possession.
