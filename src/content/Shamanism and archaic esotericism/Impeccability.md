[[Carlos Castaneda|Castaneda]] uses this word to describe the virtues of a warrior. Impeccability is the systematic, correct and efficient use of energy. To understand the word, we must see it in the context of Castaneda's writings and system of values.

Impeccability is related to being free of self-importance, being internally streamlined, unambiguous, in control of self. On one hand the impeccable warrior is traveling light, without carrying baggage of assumptions, preconceptions, beliefs, internal considering and so forth. We could say Impeccability has to do with being an empty vessel that can receive higher influences, although Castaneda does not quite put it in these terms. On the other hand, the warrior practicing impeccability has a definite path and is in no way a random or arbitrary entity. Impeccability is a combination of commitment to a path and flexibility and acuity of observation and freedom of choice.
