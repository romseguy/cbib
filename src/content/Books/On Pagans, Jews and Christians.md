_**On Pagans, Jews, and Christians**_ is a book by Italian historian Arnaldo Momigliano, first published in 1987.

The book is a collection of nineteen essays, as previously published, that focuses on interactions of Roman, Greek, Jewish, and Christian cultures, in which the author addresses to identify the first two as "profane," the latter two as "religious" cultures. This work focuses on different ways of comparative (classical and biblical) historiography.

This is one of the critical books on historiography and recommended for those who are interested in the ancient world and historiography.
