_**The Neandertal Enigma: Solving the Mystery of Modern Human Origins**_ is a book by James Shreeve, first published in 1995, which examines the scientific evidence and addresses the controversy surrounding Neanderthals' fate.

This work investigates the strange mystery of the Neanderthals, of whom suddenly disappeared during the appearance of modern man. What happened to them and why is a very great mystery and the terms of understanding this enigma change almost daily. This event is generally dated, by various dating processes, to have occurred 35,000 years ago. However, in this work, there are mysterious appearances of modern type man in several places and times long before this date that are yet to be explained.
