_**Keto-Adapted**_ is a book by Maria Emmerich, first published in 2013, which provides a practical guide to the [[Ketogenic diet|ketogenic diet]]. It is short, easy to read, and covers a lot of common issues that people run into when attempting to transition to a ketogenic diet.

Apart from giving practical suggestions, this book briefly covers the theory behind the ketogenic diet. It also contains some recipes. The combination of serving as a quick and simple introduction, and also providing useful advice on how to solve various issues, makes this book very suitable for those interested in getting started with a ketogenic diet, as well as for those who've begun and run into issues along the way.

For a deeper understanding of the theory (metabolism, macro- and micronutrients, health and illnesses, food sensitivities, etc.), additional reading is recommended. For example, _[[Diet Research of the Cassiopaea Forum]]_ (a free resource) and Nora Gedgaudas' _[[Primal Body, Primal Mind]]_ contain more thorough information.

One caveat is that Emmerich's dietary approach allows nightshades (which many are sensitive to) and dairy products (which are unhealthy due to the casein they contain). The additional recommended reading provides more information about these issues.
