_**Life Without Bread**_ is a book by Christian B. Allan and Wolfgang Lutz, first published in 2000. It is the latest English edition of Lutz' work. It describes a low-carb [[Diet|diet]] approach, and the clinical findings and metabolic knowledge on which it is based, in an easily read way.

This book is a gentle introduction for those interested in a paleo diet. Given the discussion of clinical cases, it is also especially relevant for those struggling with diabetes, gastrointestinal disorders, cardiovascular illness, or weight problems (in either direction).

Lutz and Allan cover the basics of ketogenic metabolism, the importance of saturated fat and the misconception of its supposed dangerousness. Both the overweight and the underweight will find an explanation for their issues, in how excess insulin (resulting from excess carbohydrate consumption) can lead to either one of two different kinds of hormonal imbalances.

Some important information is missing in this book, compared to works based on newer research. It does not cover gluten, dairy, and the problems with ingesting these and other specific damaging foods and substances. And for those interested in proceeding to a [[Ketogenic diet|ketogenic diet]], there is also some further relevant information which will have to be found elsewhere.

Whether you interested in what we consider a paleo or a [[Ketogenic diet|ketogenic]] approach, a good work to supplement the information in _Life Without Bread_ is Nora Gedgaudas' _[[Primal Body, Primal Mind]]_. Yet another additional work is _[[The Art and Science of Low Carbohydrate Living]]_ by Phinney and Volek.
