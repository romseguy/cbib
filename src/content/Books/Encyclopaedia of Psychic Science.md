_**Encyclopaedia of Psychic Science**_ is Nandor Fodor's _magnum opus_, first published in 1934.

This 470+ pages book is the most complied and comprehensive survey of every paranormal phenomena known to humankind, up to a time of the writing. It includes articles and case-histories dealing with a host of paranormal phenomena, including apparitions of the living and the dead, clairvoyance, medium-ship, ESPs, divination, fire immunity, levitation, predictions, and telepathy.

Other than providing a great deal of literature on the subjects concerned, it proved to be a valued reference work and arranged in an alphabetical order.
