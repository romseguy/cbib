_**The Zelator: A Modern Initiate Explores the Ancient Mysteries**_, by Mark Hedsel, edited by David Ovason, is a spiritual autobiography relating one man's travels through much of Western and some Eastern esoteric teaching. This style of free, individual searching is called the [[Way of the Fool]] in the book.

_The Zelator_ is a rich commentary on representations of esoteric principles in art, tradition, architecture, living schools and much more. At one point Hedsel discusses his studies in Paris, probably under [[George Gurdjieff]], although the latter is not specifically named.

The book is very well sourced, with extensive appendices and references. This is an excellent source for an overview of Western esoteric tradition.
