_**Making Sense of People: Decoding the Mysteries of Personality**_ is a book by Samuel Barondes, first published in 2011. It describes personality, and how it can be classified and observed, in terms of the Big Five personality traits. It also discusses the joint environmental and genetic basis of personality formation, and the question of character and character development, including how a person might deliberately work to improve his or her character.

The description in this book of how personality can be classified and observed is practically useful, both for understanding oneself and for understanding others. It serves as a good supplement to books such as _[[Strangers to Ourselves]]_ and _[[Redirect (book)|Redirect]]_, which explore deeper questions of how the mind and personality works and how a person can be unknowingly shaped by environmental influences.
