_**The Iron Elephant: What You Should Know about the Danger of Excess Body Iron**_ is a book by Roberta Crawford, first published in 1990. It discusses the deadly problem of iron overload, which can stem from hereditary hemochromatosis – a very common genetic disorder which causes excessive absorption of iron. Though easily treatable, iron overload is "tragically undiagnosed" and those afflicted are often met with ignorance.

Since the disorder is so common, most people will know one or more people who have it, which in itself is a reason to read this book.

For people on a [[Ketogenic diet|ketogenic diet]] (especially if very low in carbohydrates and fiber), the book may also be especially relevant, since it seems that absorption of iron can increase on this diet. While not discussed in the book, this is an issue that has come up in [discussion on the forum](https://cassiopaea.org/forum/index.php/topic,20265.0.html).

More generally, whether or not a person has any of the forms of hereditary hemochromatosis, it seems a good idea for everyone to test how much iron is stored in the body. Iron overload, even significantly below the levels at which it becomes deadly, can have a great impact on health. And in case a person has the opposite problem – too little iron – that is also good to know and very easy to solve.
