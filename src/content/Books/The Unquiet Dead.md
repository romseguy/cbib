_**The Unquiet Dead: A Psychologist Treats Spirit Possession**_ is a book by clinical psychologist Edith Fiore, first published in 1987.

In this book, along with case histories, the author explains to the reader on how to detect spirit possession in oneself and others, how to protect oneself from entities, how to release one's home from displaced spirits, along with a verbatim transcript of a self-depossession technique.

The author presents clinical case studies of the spirits communicating with her while their hosts, her patients, were under hypnotic trance. The patients came to her seeking help with some problem that defied customary medical or psychological treatment.
