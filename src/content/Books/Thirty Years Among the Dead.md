_**Thirty Years Among the Dead**_ by psychiatrist and psychical researcher Carl A. Wickland, first published in 1924, is a classic and one of the most important works on spirit possessions and channeling.

This book reveals the author's efforts to "cure" his patients through spiritual/psychological techniques, and one of these techniques was much similar to a spirit release therapy. He would subject his patients to an electroshock therapy in order to drive out the spirits, and these spirits would be transferred to his wife, Anna, who was a medium. By then, the author would speak with the spirits. He did this in an attempt to convince the spirits to let go of his patients and move on to the next level. In most of the cases, it was a success and the patients were "cured".

The book, consisted of 450+ pages, goes on for 17 chapters, including both the case examples and theories of spirit possessions. This work is paramount to an understanding of earthbound spirits and how they can be attached to the living people.
