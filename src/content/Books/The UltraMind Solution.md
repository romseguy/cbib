_**The UltraMind Solution: Fix Your Broken Brain by Healing Your Body First - The Simple Way to Defeat Depression, Overcome Anxiety, and Sharpen Your Mind**_ is a book by Mark Hyman, M.D., first published in 2008, which is about how to restore and improve one's brain function by restoring and improving one's health.

According to Hyman, brain function is affected by diet, nutritional deficiencies, allergens, infections, toxins and stress; simply put: diet, environment and stress. So correcting these problems can in many cases improve or even cure "mental disorders" that they caused. However, the details of Hyman's advice regarding diet are outdated given what Cassiopaea Forum members have learned since - a [[Ketogenic diet|ketogenic diet]] does better and also reduces the need for supplementation.
