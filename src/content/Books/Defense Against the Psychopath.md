_**Defense Against the Psychopath: A Brief Introduction to Human Predators**_ is a short text about [[Psychopaths|psychopaths]], written by Stefan H. Verstappen, and published as part of his book _The Art of Urban Survival_. It can serve as a quick primer on the subject of psychopathy, including the roles psychopaths can play in society, and awareness of them so as to be able to protect oneself.

Verstappen has also made a [video version](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MgGyvxqYSbE). Both the video and a [PDF download](http://www.chinastrategies.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/defenseagainstpsychopath.pdf) of the text are freely available.
