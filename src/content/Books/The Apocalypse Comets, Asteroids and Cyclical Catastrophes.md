_**The Apocalypse: Comets, Asteroids and Cyclical Catastrophes**_ is a book by [[Laura Knight-Jadczyk]], published in 2012.

This book describes and references the evidence for a long history of catastrophes, our present situation in relation to these and what is likely to come. It is based upon the [Comets and Catastrophe](http://www.sott.net/topic/10-Comets-and-Catastrophe-Series) article series on SotT and other researches by the author. The author also tied together the modern-day celebrations of the dead, paganism, the origins of monotheistic religions, all the while highlighting just how blind the human beings remain to the comets and the implications for the future (a stunning indictment on modern day science and politics).

_[[Comets and the Horns of Moses]]_ covers the same theme along with much wider subject ground.
