_**The Haunted Mind: A Psychoanalyst Looks at the Supernatural**_ by Nandor Fodor, published in 1959, gives accounts of investigations into the cases of paranormal phenomena, including haunting, poltergeists, black magic, "The Ash Manor Ghost," Out-of-Body Experiences, Reincarnations, and the "voices" from the spirit world.

This book investigates the idea that paranormal phenomena and poltergeists are projections of living people's minds.
