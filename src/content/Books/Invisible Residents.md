_**Invisible Residents: The Reality of Underwater UFOs**_ is a classic book by biologist Ivan T. Sanderson, originally published in 1970 as _Invisible Residents: A Disquisition upon Certain Matters Maritime, and the Possibility of Intelligent Life under the Waters of This Earth_.

This book is an exemplar treatise on unexplained incidents in the world's oceans. Sanderson makes a case for the existence of "Other Intelligences - live under the oceans" (OINTS), which are as twice as old as Human beings. He also proposed that the OINTS are responsible for UFO (Unidentified Flying Object) and USO (Unidentified Submarine Object) sightings and many mysterious disappearances of ships and planes in the Bermuda Triangle, listing more than fifty unexplained cases.
