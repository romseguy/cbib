_**Unleashed: Of Poltergeists and Murder: The Curious Story of Tina Resch**_ is a book by parapsychologist William Roll and Valerie Storey, published in 2004, which is Tina Resch's story as told by a parapsychologist who witnessed striking paranormal phenomena in Tina's presence and sobering examination of a child's mysterious murder.

Dr. Roll was the parapsychologist brought in to investigate, and this book is an account of the events leading up to his arrival, the ones that occurred during the week he spent at the Resch residence, his later research with Tina on her psychokinesis abilities, and the later controversy surrounding the death of her three-year-old daughter.

The book is a great account of a classic poltergeist case, a tragic true crime account, and an insightful psychological study.
