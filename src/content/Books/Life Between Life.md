_**Life Between Life**_ is a book by psychiatrist Joel L. Whitton and paranormal writer Joe Fisher, first published in 1986.

In this book, Dr. Whitton works with hypnotic regression into past lives, and it is mainly focused on the "in-between life states" or "in-between times". The responses from his hypnotized subjects has emphasized that when the soul enters the body is varied: some reported it more towards the beginning of the pregnancy, others just before the birth, few right after the birth. This gives one an notion that there is no experience of "souls entering their bodies" as being the same, but there are certainly some similarities in some aspects. Also, the book also discusses how past lives can affect or influence present lives, with some great examples.
