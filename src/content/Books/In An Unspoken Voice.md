_**In An Unspoken Voice: How the Body Releases Trauma and Restores Goodness**_ is a book by Peter A. Levine, first published in 2010. It explores the physiological basis of trauma and a body-centered method of recovery. The theory is based on neuroscience and behavioral studies, and the practice (called Somatic Experiencing) on clinical experience.

While dealing with trauma through intellectual and emotional exploration can make a difference, involving the body is a powerful approach often overlooked. This is an important book, both for understanding trauma and how it might be healed, and because it gives the knowledge of prevention: how to avoid becoming traumatized by overwhelming experiences of the future.

This kind of information ties into and complements that found in the '[[Recommended books|Narcissism "big five"]]' psychology books, in providing an understanding of trauma and how it affects the nervous system – and through the nervous system, the entire body.
