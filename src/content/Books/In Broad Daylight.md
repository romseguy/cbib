_**In Broad Daylight: A Murder in Skidmore, Missouri**_ is a 1988 true crime book by Harry N. MacLean, describing the story of the killing of Ken Rex McElroy on the main street of Skidmore, Missouri in July 1981.

This book details the case of Ken Rex McElroy and his 21-year reign of terror throughout four counties in northwest Missouri, and the ultimate murder of McElroy, who was shot to death in broad daylight as he sat in his pickup truck on the mainstreet of the town. Despite the fact that there were more than 45 witnesses to the killing, no one has been prosecuted for the killing.

The story is a good example of how a low-life [[psychopath]] can hold people hostage as well as how people may finally stand up to such a monster.
