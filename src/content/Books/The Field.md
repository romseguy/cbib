_**The Field: The Quest for the Secret Force of the Universe**_ is a book by journalist Lynne McTaggart, first published in 2001.

The book presents a scientific paradigm in which the human mind and body are not separate from the environment and explains how everything is connected by the Zero Point Field (ZPF) - a sea of energy that reconciles mind with matter with experimental observations.

The scientific experiments presented in this book are important for those who are familiar with the C's material and with alchemy.
