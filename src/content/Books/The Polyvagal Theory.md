_**The Polyvagal Theory**_ is a book by Stephen W. Porges, first published in 2011. It presents a highly informative collection of scientific papers on the behavioral and regulatory role of the autonomic nervous system, especially emotionally and socially.

The vagus nerve is a major part of the regulatory system that moves us between calmer states on the one hand and fight, flight, or freeze responses on the other. It has multiple branches, hence the word 'polyvagal'. If fight, flight, or freeze responses are triggered inappropriately, then among other things, a person will be less able to handle social interaction and to think in a clear, level-headed way. The older, more primitive systems take over. If such responses are not triggered when appropriate, however, then this can be a danger, because they are meant to ensure survival in situations where a quick and decisive response is needed.

The vagus nerve is important for emotional regulation and responses in general. Controlled stimulation (e.g. as done through our [[Éiriú Eolas]] program) can greatly help emotional processing, both as a way to calm down and deal with stress and as a way to recover from trauma. Dysregulation can be found in various disorders involving emotional problems, trauma, or difficulties with sensory processing or with social interaction.

This book gives a valuable in-depth understanding, but is also among the more challenging reads on our recommended books list. The [Cassiopaea Forum thread](https://cassiopaea.org/forum/index.php/topic,23603.0.html) contains some discussion and other information that may be helpful in reading it.
