_**Prophecy in Our Time**_ is a book by Martin Ebon, first published in 1968.

This 225+ pages book surveys several areas as relating to one of the fascinating paranormal phenomena known as "prophecy", ranging from theoretical physics to the time theory of J. W. Dunne, whose work that the author discussed in length in third chapter. This is not a document study of the prophecy in the ancient times, but in our present era (that is, as of 1968), including the sinking of the _Titanic_ and the assassination of President Kennedy, Hitler's entourage of prophets, Edgar Cayce's ESP theories, Gerard Grosset's personality predictions, arguments between Jung and Freud, Dr. Rhine's experiments, and so on. Here, he discusses the psychological forces behind some people's subconscious fulfillment of their own premonitions.
