_**Channeling: Investigations on Receiving Information from Paranormal Sources**_ is a comprehensive study on channeling by Jon Klimo, first published in 1987. It consists of ten chapters with a foreword by Charles Tart.

In this book, Klimo profiles a number of recent channels and their sources, going back to the pre-civilization era and identifies certain figures in history as "channels", including Moses, Solomon, Muhammad, Merlin, Nostradamus, Swendenborg, Edgar Cayce, Jane Roberts and others.

Encyclopedic in scope and filled with interesting stories and case examples, this book presents a classic work on the phenomenon of channeling.
