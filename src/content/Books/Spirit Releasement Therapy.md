_**Spirit Releasement Therapy: A Technique Manual**_ is a book by William J. Baldwin, D.D.S., Ph.D., first published in 1993.

This "manual", with over 420 pages and five sections, provides a great deal of original techniques to be utilized in a spirit release treatment and help those who are dealing with such difficult "attachments" that were hindering their way of life. Into this book, Dr. Baldwin has integrated a range of techniques and experiences from past-life therapy, spirit possession syndrome, soul retrieval, inner child work, multiple personality disorder (or dissociative identity disorder), and traditional psychotherapy.

The book is a good primer on a very complex subject, but does not cover all of the essential aspects, nor is it wholly accurate. While a good start for background, further readings to fill in the gaps include:

*   _[[Thirty Years Among the Dead]]_ by Carl A. Wickland
*   _[[The Unquiet Dead]] by Edith Fiore_
*   _[[Life Between Life]]_ by Joel Whitton
*   _[[Hostage to the Devil]]_ by Malachi Martin
*   _[[The Haunted Mind]]_ by Nandor Fodor
