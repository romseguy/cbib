_**Operation Trojan Horse**_ (or _**UFOs: Operation Trojan Horse**_) is a book by John Keel, published in 1970.

In this book, the author linked UFOs to supernatural concepts such as humanoid encounters, monsters, ghosts and demons. Also, Keel used the term "ultraterrestrials" to describe UFO occupants he believed to be non-human entities capable of taking on any form they wish.

The book, the result of four years of research and interviews with thousands of individuals, presents Keel's hypothesis that UFOs are a phenomenon produced by "ultraterrestrials" or "ultradimensional", beings who are able to manipulate matter and perceptions, and in the past, they manifested themselves as fairies, demons, poltergeists, angels, and lake monsters, rather than "extraterrestrial" in origin..
