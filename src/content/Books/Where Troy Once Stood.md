_**Where Troy Once Stood**_ is a book by Iman Wilkens, first published in 1990. This book argues that the city of Troy was located in England and that the Trojan War was fought between groups of Celts.

In this book, the author demonstrates that the Trojan War geography recorded in ancient writings do not fit Turkish geography, but closely match that of Britain and Europe. His evidence to support this includes detailed maps, countless archaeological finds, historic place name matching, ancient historic writings, accurate geographic and topographic matching, cultural and linguistic evidence.
