_**The Book of the Damned**_ is a book by Charles Hoy Fort, first published in 1919. This is the first of Fort's four books, followed by _[[New Lands]]_ (1923), _[[Lo!]]_ (1931) and _[[Wild Talents]]_ (1932) - all of which focuses on "anomalous phenomena", which were frequently misunderstood and misrepresented by "Dogmatic Science" of that period. The title of this book - "damned" - refers to "damned" or excluded data that Fort collected.

This work deals with various types of anomalous phenomena, including what we now refers to as [[UFO]], strange creatures, unexplained disappearances, odd weather patterns, and so forth. All of these strange phenomena led him to conclude that the Earth is a "possession" of something, by saying "I think we're property".

The book can be read on [Sacred Texts website](http://www.sacred-texts.com/fort/damn/index.htm) or on [Internet Archive](https://archive.org/details/bookdamnedbycha00fortgoog).
