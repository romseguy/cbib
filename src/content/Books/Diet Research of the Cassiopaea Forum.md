_**Diet Research of the Cassiopaea Forum: A Summary of the Science Background**_ is one of the working titles for a book in the making by Gabriela Segura, M.D. It summarizes the findings of years of diet research done by the Cassiopaea.org community together with editors of [[Signs of the Times]]. A rough draft – containing essentially all of the information, but made before proofreading and further editing – has been [made available](https://cassiopaea.org/forum/index.php/topic,34581.msg511468.html#msg511468) for free to all forum members in 2014.

When it comes to the theory of the [[Ketogenic diet|ketogenic diet]], this book can save readers the time needed to go through various other books, as well as the two large Cassiopaea Forum discussion threads on diet, "[Life Without Bread](https://cassiopaea.org/forum/index.php/topic,22916.0.html)" and "[Ketogenic Diet – Path To Transformation?](https://cassiopaea.org/forum/index.php/topic,28799.0.html)".

A second book is also being worked on, and is meant to provide a practical guide to dietary transition. Such information is very important, because there are a number of common stumbling blocks and individual issues that may be encountered, which almost always have known and simple solutions.

In the meantime, there's another book which also provides a great practical guide, easily read and understood and recommended to everyone interested in the ketogenic diet. That book is Maria Emmerich's _[[Keto-Adapted]]_. Being an excellent read, it will continue to be recommended even after Segura finishes the practical guide.

There are also other recommended books that provide information for those interested in a paleo- or [[Ketogenic diet|ketogenic diet]]. _[[Primal Body, Primal Mind]]_ by Nora T. Gedgaudas is another books which comprehensively covers much theory, and also gives some advice for people with particular needs. Further books are listed on the [[Recommended books|recommended books]] page, under the [[Recommended books|Health and diet section]].
