_**The Case for the UFO**_ is a book by Morris K. Jessup, first published in 1955, in which he argued that [[UFO]] represented a mysterious subject worthy of further study and presents issues surrounding the presence/observances of extraterrestrial beings and their manifestations. For this book, the author did an extensive research in the field of astronomy and his work pre-dates others, who drew the same conclusions (including Erich von DÃ¤niken). This book also reveals the story about the legendary [[Philadelphia Experiment]].

An "varo" edition was published after author Jessup "mysteriously" died - one copy of this edition became annotated from within the Navy. [[Laura Knight-Jadczyk]] discussed this edition and Jessup in the [fifty-fifth chapter](http://cassiopaea.org/2012/01/25/the-wave-chapter-55-%E2%80%A8albert-einstein-free-energy-and-the-strange-deaths-of-morris-k-jessup-and-stefan-marinov/) of her [[The Wave Series|_The Wave_]].

The annotated Varo edition of this book is available as a [free PDF download](http://www.cassiopaea.org/cass/Varo-Jessup.PdF).
