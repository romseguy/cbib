_**Primal Body, Primal Mind**_ is a book by Nora Gedgaudas, first published in 2009. It is a comprehensive and highly recommended resource for those interested in the [[Ketogenic diet|ketogenic diet]].

This book covers a wide range of subjects, including but not limited to: the problems with gluten, dairy, soy and sugar; the low-carb, moderate-protein, high-fat approach; and supplementation according to individual needs. It gives information important for all aspects of dietary transition.

In addition to this book, Maria Emmerich's _[[Keto-Adapted]]_ serves well as a practical guide to dietary transition.

Another read that provides a broad range of theoretical information is Gabriela Segura's _[[Diet Research of the Cassiopaea Forum]]_.
