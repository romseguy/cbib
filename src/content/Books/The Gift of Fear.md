_**The Gift of Fear: Survival Signals That Protect Us From Violence**_ is a book by Gavin de Becker, originally published in 1997.

Drawing on decades of studying violent behavior, the author exposes the myth that many violent acts are random and unpredictable and how they are revealed to have distinguishable motives and are preceded by clear warning signs or "gut feelings". In this book, he shares a number of case examples that demonstrate the "danger signals" that many victims missed and offers strategies to aid the reader to avoid violence by revealing a list of warning signs or "fears" (pre-incident indicators or PINs) that can be paid attention to.

When utilized properly, fear becomes a "protective gift" from dangers and can be separated from unwarranted anxiety.

This is a practical book that can be read along with _[[Blink (book)|Blink]]_.
