_**The Noah Syndrome**_ is the first and long-unpublished book by [[Laura Knight-Jadczyk]], published in 2012.

This book was written in the mid-1980s, introducing the concept of quantum cosmic metamorphosis and a serious look at Earth's cataclysmic history, making it more relevant for today. The author draws on prophecies ancient and new - from biblical narratives to modern-day visionaries - yet grounded in cutting-edge scientific discoveries about earth's cataclysmic history, which this book presents a remarkable vision of humanity's dramatic past and extremely hazardous future.

Some passages from this book may be recognized from their appearance in _The Wave_ series and in the first volume of _[[The Secret History of the World]]_.
