_**You Are Not So Smart: Why You Have Too Many Friends on Facebook, Why Your Memory Is Mostly Fiction, and 46 Other Ways You're Deluding Yourself**_ is a book by David McRaney, first published in 2011. In an informative, yet humorous and easy-going way, it describes a large number of cognitive biases, logical fallacies, and in general, ways in which people think and act which are not in their own best interests, as a result of the flaws of the human [[Brain|brain]] and mind.

This book gives an excellent overview of many troublesome tendencies of the human brain, and the ways in which they can make us delude ourselves, derail us, and keep us from acting in our own best interests. It can be a helpful (and entertaining) read for better understanding these flaws of our nature, and how to take them into account so as to less often fall prey to them.

David McRaney has also written a follow-up, titled _You Are Now Less Dumb_.
