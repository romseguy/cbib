_**Without Conscience: The Disturbing World of the Psychopaths Among Us**_ is a book by [[Psychopathy|psychopathy]] expert Robert D. Hare, first published in 1993. It is one of the most accessible, easy-to-read introductions to the reality of psychopathy.

The author describes psychopaths as "social predators who charm, manipulate, and ruthlessly plow their way through life, leaving a broad trail of broken hearts, shattered expectations, and empty wallets...completely lacking in conscience and in feelings for others, they selfishly take what they want and do as they please, violating social norms and expectations without the slightest sense of guilt or regret".[\[1\]](#cite_note-1) In this book, he presents a compelling portrait of these dangerous individuals, based on 25 years of distinguished scientific research and debunks some of the myths of psychopathy.
