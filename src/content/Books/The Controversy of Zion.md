_**The Controversy of Zion**_ is a book by Douglas Reed, published in 1978, which examines 2,000 years of history of Zionism, its ideological leaders, development and establishment as well as analysing _[[The Protocols of the Learned Elders of Zion]]_. This work was completed in 1956, but not submitted for publication until two years after Reed's death.

This book provides a stark view of historical developments and goes well with _[[Political Ponerology]]_.
