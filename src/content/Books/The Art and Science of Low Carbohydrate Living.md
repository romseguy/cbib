_**The Art and Science of Low Carbohydrate Living**_ is a book by Stephen D. Phinney and Jeff S. Volek, first published in 2011. It provides extensive information for those interested in a low-carb approach (and especially in a [[Ketogenic diet|ketogenic diet]]), and gets pretty close to the ketogenic approach we have arrived at.

It should be noted that this book does not cover the problems with gluten, dairy, soy, and other specific problematic foods and substances. Phinney and Volek's recommendation regarding the amount of protein to eat is also more liberal than that recommended by e.g. Nora Gedgaudas in _[[Primal Body, Primal Mind]]_, another great book for those interested in a low-carb approach (and one that addresses the problems with the mentioned specific foods).
