_**With the Tongues of Men and Angels: A Study of Channeling**_ is a short book by Arthur Hastings, first published in 1991. A useful study of the [channeling]([[Channeling and channeled material]]) phenomenon, though not very comprehensive, it mainly focus on various "mediums" who channel, rather than on channeling itself.

The mediums covered include Edgar Cayce, Jane Roberts, Alice A. Bailey, Eileen J. Garrett, and others. In combining a range of historical figures with modern ones, and in describing theories which explain the phenomenon, the author has provided an insightful work. It can serve as a good additional introductory read on the subject of channeling.
