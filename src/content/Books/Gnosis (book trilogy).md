_**Gnosis: Study and Commentaries on the Esoteric Tradition of Eastern Orthodoxy**_ is a three-volume work by [[Boris Mouravieff]], first published in French in 1961, which documents the inner tradition of Eastern Orthodoxy.

The trilogy volumes are as follows:

*   **Book One:** The Exoteric Cycle
*   **Book Two:** The Mesoteric Cycle
*   **Book Three:** The Esoteric Cycle

The _Gnosis_ books go deeper into the theory of the [[Fourth Way]], complementing the material transmitted by [[George Gurdjieff|Gurdjieff]] and [[P. D. Ouspensky|Ouspensky]].

It is advised to keep in mind that Mouravieff had his Christian as well as ideological biases which colored his works (he was influenced by the Synarchy of [Schwaller de Lubicz](http://cassiopaea.org/2010/09/17/schwaller-de-lubicz-and-the-fourth-reich/) and naïvely believed in the formation of a benign "elite" which would rule the world and lead it to a better future). These biases are easy to filter out, and there is much of value to be found in _Gnosis_.

Laura wrote of the work of Mouravieff that:[\[1\]](#cite_note-1)

> \[It\] provides provides that ineluctable bridge between the works of Gurdjieff, the Sufi Shaykh, Ibn al-'Arabi, the esoteric Christianity that I have conjectured to have existed during megalithic times and of which we only have ancient Siberian Shamanism as a shadow of a relic, hermeticism/alchemy, and the Cassiopaean Transmissions - my own "channeling."
