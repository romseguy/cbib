_**The Caricature of Love**_ is a book by Hervey M. Cleckley, first published in 1957. It discusses distortions or "caricatures" of love and sexuality. Though written without the knowledge of [[Ponerology|ponerology]], it shows the mindset and influence of pathological characters in these matters throughout culture, both past and present.

This book reflects a very dated understanding of homosexuality, and Cleckley conflates it with the pathological attitudes and ways of thinking he is examining. Cleckley's conclusions were in large part based on a study of his patients, many of whom were [[Psychopaths|psychopaths]]. If the reader takes this into account, the book remains of great value for understanding the [[ponerization]] of love, relationships, and sexuality, including how women have been degraded throughout history. The discussion of this book [on the Cassiopaea Forum](https://cassiopaea.org/forum/index.php/topic,21284.msg209001.html#msg209001) provides context in this and other regards and describes the significance of this book.

The type of pathological character which Cleckley identifies, in various of the modern and historical persons, seems to correspond closely to what [[Andrew M. Lobaczewski|Andrzej ≈Åobaczewski]] called "asthenic psychopathy" in his work _[[Political Ponerology]]_.

This book has fallen into the public domain, and can be downloaded as a PDF. It has also been [reprinted](http://www.redpillpress.com/shop/the-caricature-of-love/) by [Red Pill Press](https://www.redpillpress.com/).
