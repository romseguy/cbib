_**The Ra Material**_ (later editions changed the title to _**The Law of One**_) is a collected series of transcripts in five books, of more than 100 sessions with the channeled entity named [[Ra]], channeled by Carla Rueckert with Don Elkins and Jim Mc Carthy during the period from 1981 to 1984.

This material was suggested by the [[Cassiopaeans]] as a primer for the Cassiopaea information. _The Ra Material's_ greatest usefulness is in giving general definitions to the concepts of [[Density|density]], [service to self vs service to others]([[Service to others and service to self]]), [[Free will|free will]] and presenting a general cosmology.
