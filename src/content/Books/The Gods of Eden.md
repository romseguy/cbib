_**The Gods of Eden**_ is a book by historian William Bramley, first published in 1989.

This book is a result of seven years of intensive research where the author uncovered the sinister thread that links humanity's darkest events – from the wars of the ancient pharaohs to the assassination of JFK with disturbing evidence of an alien presence on Earth – extraterrestrial visitors who have conspired to dominate Humankind through violence and chaos since the beginning of time. The author's studies indicated very strongly that this extraterrestrial race does not have humanity's best interests at heart.

One important point from this book is that when one consider history, it can clearly be seen that the drive of human beings to have peace is as strong, if not stronger, than the drive to have war. However, when the issue of war is examined, one realizes that, most often, the "trigger" for war and related "inhumanity to man" is that the drive for spiritual freedom is twisted by manipulation.
