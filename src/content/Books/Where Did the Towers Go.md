_**Where Did the Towers Go? Evidence of Directed Free-energy Technology on 9/11**_ is a book by Judy D. Wood, first published in 2010, which presents a theory that the Twin Towers of the World Trade Center on 11 September 2001 did not collapse but were "dustified" by a directed energy weapon.

Wood appears on the whole to be a disinformation distraction: for many, her presentation has the effect of discrediting the basic ideas by association. In addition, her ideas regarding free energy are a red herring and do not stand up to scrutiny. Nevertheless, the question of where the towers went is a valid one; they were observed to "turn to dust", and the conclusion that some kind of unknown (to the public) technology was utilized is a valid one. The book contains a collection of some valuable data for those who sift it out.
