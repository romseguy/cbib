_**Georgi Ivanovitch Gurdjieff: The Man, the Teaching, His Mission**_ is a comprehensive work of scholarship by William Patrick Patterson on the life and teachings of [[George Gurdjieff|Gurdjieff]] and [[Fourth Way|The Fourth Way]], published in 2014.

This extensive tome includes material from all of Gurdjieff's direct students and their library archives, much of it not available until in the recent years, and this book is assembled in a chronological form from Gurdjieff's birth until his death. This work replaces Patterson's 1996 book, _Struggle of the Magicians_, with much more information on the later years - and the focus and overall picture ends up broader and clearer with all the additional information.

The book is highly recommended for a deeper exploration of the "story" of Gurdjieff and his students â€“ the events, the people, and some perspective on the teaching.
