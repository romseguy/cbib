_**The Power of the Pendulum**_ is a posthumous book by archaeologist/psychic researcher T. C. Lethbridge, first published in 1976, which documents the author's research into dowsing by means of the pendulum and his experiments with dreams, concluding that there are other "realms" outside our perceptions or our sense of reality.

Combining the skills of a scientist with a completely open mind, Lethbridge conducted a series of experiments, shared in this book, that convinced him of the existence of hyperdimensional realms that interact dynamically with our own.

This book and its author was discussed in Laura Knight-Jadczyk's _[[The Secret History of the World]]_.
