_**New Light on the Black Death: The Cosmic Connection**_ is a book by Mike Baillie, published in 2006. This book makes a compelling case for the nature of the Black Death in A.D. 1348, drawing upon tree ring and Greenland ice core evidence, along with contemporary accounts and mythical stories. The evidence suggests that the deaths were actually the result of cometary interactions.

Not only does the author provide evidence for the nature of the Black Death, but also for the similar nature of previous events, such as the prior global environmental catastrophe of A.D. 540 (which included the Plague of Justinian), and the Plague of Athens in A.D. 430.
