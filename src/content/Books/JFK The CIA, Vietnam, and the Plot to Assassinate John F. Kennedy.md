_**JFK: The CIA, Vietnam, and the Plot to Assassinate John F. Kennedy**_ is a book by L. Fletcher Prouty, first published in 1992, which gives a sobering overview of what happened on the day of assassination of President John F. Kennedy and proposed his death as a _coup d'Ã©tat_ that placed in the White House a very different man "controlled" by a psychopathic elite.

A blurb on [Barnes and Noble](http://www.barnesandnoble.com/w/jfk-l-fletcher-prouty/1003379923) gives a good overview of the book:

> For decades, the truth about the assassination of President John F. Kennedy has been obscured by those with an agenda of one kind or another. Colonel L. Fletcher Prouty has, in his interviews, letters, and books, explained the motives and methods behind the plot to topple an American president.
> 
> _JFK: The CIA, Vietnam, and the Plot to Assassinate John F. Kennedy_ provides a fascinating perspective on the assassination. L. Fletcher Prouty draws on his experience and insider knowledge to review the particular security arrangements in Dallas on November 22, 1963, and other circumstances to support his belief that Kennedy's murder was, in fact, a carefully played and professionally executed coup d'etat.
> 
> Prouty's work was a source for Oliver Stone's movie, _JFK_, and he was the basis for the Donald Sutherland character "X" in the movie. Anyone who suspects that the Warren Report didn't reveal the whole truth about the murder of President Kennedy, or is interested in an insider's perspective on one of America's most shocking crimes, will want to read Prouty's views.

In a [forum thread](https://cassiopaea.org/forum/index.php/topic,12525.0.html) about this book, [[Laura Knight-Jadczyk]] wrote:

> It's not just another book that goes endlessly over the evidence (or lack) of the JFK assassination, it is much, much more than that. Prouty was a gov insider and in his effort to explain how Viet Nam and the Cold War "happened," he provides a ton of insight into the minds and attitudes of the "insiders" or the "power elite." I think it is a "must read" for anyone who wants to understand what is going on in our world today.
