_**Molecules Of Emotion: The Science Behind Mind-Body Medicine**_ is a book by neuroscientist Candace B. Pert, first published in 1997, which concerns with how the chemicals inside our bodies form a dynamic information network, linking mind and body.

In this book, the author presents a clear and often riveting account of her research on the frontier of a new kind of science - _peptides_ - and how the emotions are the link between the mind and the body.
