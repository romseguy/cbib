_**The New Pearl Harbor: Disturbing Questions About the Bush Administration and 9/11**_ is a book by theologian David Ray Griffin, originally published in 2004, which exposes the flaws in the "official version" of 9/11 events.

In this book, the author examines the known facts of the events to create a pattern and analyzes the time line and physical evidence of September 11 for unresolved inconsistencies. This book vigorously discredits the "official 9/11 story" and compares each of Washington, D.C.'s major 9/11 claims to actual facts uncovered by independent research.

Griffin's 2008 _The New Pearl Harbor Revisited: 9/11, the Cover-Up, and the Expos√©_ is a companion volume to the 2004 book with updated information and provides in-depth analysis of the evidence that has emerged since 2004.
