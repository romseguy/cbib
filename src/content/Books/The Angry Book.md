_**The Angry Book**_ is a book by psychiatrist Theodore Isaac Rubin, first published in 1969.

This book describes the negative consequences of suppressing anger; how various issues result from the building of a "slush fund" (an accumulation of stale anger). It also describes how to approach anger with a healthy mindset and express it in a constructive way, thereby avoiding the issues caused by a build-up of "slush" - and healing those already caused.

From the book's Introduction, the author wrote:[\[1\]](#cite_note-1)

> This book is about a basic human emotion - _anger_. Too often anger is not seen as basic or human. Anger is easily the most maligned and perverted of feelings and responses. Although there is an enormous range of "angry problems", nearly all people have some difficulty handling anger. The price paid for the distortion of a basic emotion is incalculable. Poor mental health, poor physical health, damage to relationships - especially to parent-child relationships - and even that most malignant of human diseases - _war_ - are the wages of distorted anger.
> 
> Therefore it behooves us to understand and to work through our feelings of anger. As you read, you will see that insight into these feelings can free and make available many other feelings, talents, and potentials. A healthier _angry_ outlook must lead to greater health, to improved parent-child relating, to a fuller life, and to success and happiness. Indeed, it can even be lifesaving.
