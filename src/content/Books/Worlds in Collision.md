_**Worlds in Collision**_ is a classic book by Immanuel Velikovsky, first published in 1950.

This work described a notion of an enormous comet having passed near Earth, causing a number of catastrophes that were depicted in the Earth mythologies, and this comet was to be Venus. Then, the author discussed further about the planet Mars, which also made a near pass to Earth in the later period, causing more catastrophes. These events were occurred before the planetary system was orderly established as we now know it.

Along with the prologue and epilogue chapters, this book consisted of two parts ("Venus" and "Mars"). The first part focuses on mythologies and legends surrounding the comet Venus and it near passes to Earth, causing disasters and catastrophes as experienced by the human beings of the ancient times. He used numerous accounts from any sacred writings, such as Egyptian, Hebrews, and many others. He also pointed out the "planet" Venus was documented to be absent from the early planetary system. The second part of this book discussed the possible collision between Venus and Mars as depicted in mythologies to which the orbit of Mars was changed, and quite possibly made a near passes to Earth, causing further catastrophes and shifted Earth's orbit from 360 days a year to 365 days a year, after Venus made her first appearance in the solar system.

As the basis of this book, the author stated that the cataclysms of Earth in the historical times were caused by the close passes between Earth and Venus and between Earth and Mars. While his theory is considered controversial and outrageous by the scientific community, it is recommended since he based his researches on mythologies as well on geological records.
