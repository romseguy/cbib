_**The Stargate Conspiracy: The Truth about Extraterrestrial life and the Mysteries of Ancient Egypt**_ is a book by Lynn Picknett and Clive Prince, first published in 1999. This book is a critical look into the history of the New Age movement in general and alternative Egyptology in particular.

The first part of the book examines and critiques the theories of alternative Egyptologists Robert Bauval and Graham Hancock. These and other authors have written numerous books on supposed stellar alignments of features of the Giza pyramid complex. The field is broad and we do not have space to go into detail here.

The second part of the book discusses the history of the channeling phenomenon and the New Age movement. This covers areas such as the human potential movement, mass culture classics such as _Star Trek_, alternative science, Esalen, psychic research by the intelligence community, Andreja Puharich, Ira Einhorn, Uri Geller and many other names well known to those who have studied the rise of the New Age.

The central proposition of the book is that there is a highly placed, secretive group of people who by all appearances think that the Nine gods of ancient Egypt are returning to Earth. The group includes intelligence community people, scientists, New Age trendsetters, intellectuals, channelers, entertainment industry people, psi researchers , alternative historians, all together in a strange cocktail. Even if the people in question do not all themselves believe this, they apparently wish to generally insert the idea of the reality of the gods of the Egyptian Ennead and of the possibility of their return into the popular mind.

The would-be gods of Egypt appear today as a channeled source that calls itself the Nine. This has been channeled by various people, including Uri Geller ever since the 1950's. The Esalen institute was for example run strictly following the Nine's dictates. A peculiarity of the messages of the Nine is their claim that Earth is the only planet where free will exists. Humans have misused this free will and caused great trouble in the cosmos. The gods will have to intervene. This is in stark contrast with the cosmology of Ra and Cassiopaea where free will is the central principle of all creation but has been severely curtailed on Earth by various agencies. The Nine have sort of turned this upside down. Their take on the question of free will would make them a clearly STS source.

As any operation meant to subtly influence mass thought, the New Age theme is distributed through a very diverse set of outlets and is not easily traceable to any one source. However it seems that the founding philosophies concerning the coming of a new era and of the need for a spiritually enlightened elite for guiding the world broke to the surface in the late 19th century through people such as Helena Blavatzky and her theosophical movement. Other mediums such as Alice Bailey added to this later. These thoughts were then integrated into the synarchistic thinking of the early 20th century. The whole idea of the returning gods and of their synarchistic priesthood is fundamentally against appreciating individual free will.

We can say that the various people and movements documented in _Stargate Conspiracy_ have left a mark on culture. Most of the information and systems of thought thus promoted have a synarchistic or elitist bias and little regard for the individual. . We could speculate that this is a project for mass-acclimatization to an open alien presence of the STS variety. The much-hyped culture of ancient Egypt appears to have itself taken the idea of theocracy, divine rulership and synarchy to a high level. Also the worship of the physical body, as symbolized by the whole culture of momification seems very materialistic. We are thus not surprised that modern synarchists seek to elevate ancient Egypt to some exemplary status.

The book is well researched and offers the history of the founders of the New Age in a compact package, tracing it back to the 19th century and sometimes earlier. The book suffers from a blanket rejection of all channeled material as the work of misleading and self-serving powers and may thus throw the baby out with the bathwater. The book is not particularly esoteric nor does it make any deeper interpretations of the human condition but is good as far as it goes.
