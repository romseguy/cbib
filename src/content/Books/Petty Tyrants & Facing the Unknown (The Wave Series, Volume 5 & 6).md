_**Petty Tyrants & Facing the Unknown: Navigating the Traps and Diversions of Life in the Matrix**_ is the fifth and sixth volumes of _The Wave_ series by [[Laura Knight-Jadczyk]], published in 2011 as the new edition of combined books of _Petty Tyrants_ and _Facing the Unknown_.

These two volumes continue the series, starting with chapter 33 and ends with chapter 56.

In _Petty Tyrants_, the author draws on her experiences with so-called "Petty Tyrants", a term having come from [[Carlos Castaneda]]'s _[[The Fire from Within]]_ to describe torments and controls over a person by a tyrannical or authoritarian individual. And, this volume will bring the reader to understand the dangers and the draining effects of so-called Petty Tyrants and how one can recognize them.

The _Facing the Unknown_ volume is a further narrative from the fifth volume and to understand the dangers of the unseen Control System and the author's further experiences with her Petty Tyrants. This volume also included the events and discussions surrounding the infamous "Philadelphia Experiments," the mysterious deaths of Morris K. Jessup and Stefan Marinov as well the discussion of Frequency Resonance Vibration (FRV) and the psychomantium.
