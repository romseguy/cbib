_**Signature in the Cell: DNA and the Evidence for Intelligent Design**_ is a book by philosopher Stephen C. Meyer, first published in 2009. It is the precursor to the author's 2013 book _[[Darwin’s Doubt|Darwin's Doubt]]_ and focuses on the problem of the origin of genetic information and the case for intelligent design, using a few arguments and concepts similar to those of Bryant M. Shiller's _Origin of Life: The 5th Option_.

The explanations in this book were clear, arguments well-structured, and a good deal of solid references. It is essentially an introduction to intelligent design focusing on DNA and the origins of life.
