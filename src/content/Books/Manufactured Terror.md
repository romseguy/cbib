_**Manufactured Terror: The Boston Marathon Bombings, Sandy Hook, Aurora Shooting and Other False Flag Terror Attacks**_ is a Sott.net anthology by Joe Quinn and Niall Bradley, first published in 2014.

This book covers the biggest mass shootings and terror attacks in recent memory: from the Fort Hood, Sandy Hook, Washington Navy Yard and Aurora theater shootings to the Boston Marathon bombing and Toulouse attacks. Included are original, on-the-spot reports and subsequent analyses showing the contradictions and distortions in the official accounts. After looking at all the evidence, it's clear that we have not been told the truth about these attacks. From eyewitness reports of multiple shooters to intelligence-agency connections, the major attacks in recent years show all the hallmarks of manufactured terror.
