_**Stasiland: Stories from Behind the Berlin Wall**_ by Anna Funder, first published in 2003, is a journalistic account describing pathocracy from inside the East German regime before the Fall of the Berlin Wall. It contains the collection of the personal stories, interviews, documents that painted a sobering picture of what that country have been going through. It is also a very critical and shocking appraisal of an inhuman political system in which a few psychopathic personalities torture the masses they fear.

Essentially, this book tells an engaging story of what it was like to work for the secret police, Stasi, and of those in the resistance against the regime.

In addition, those who wish to get somewhat of a feel for life under the Stasi can see the fictional movie, _The Lives of Others_.
