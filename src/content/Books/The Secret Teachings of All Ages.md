_**The Secret Teachings of All Ages: An Encyclopedic Outline of Masonic, Hermetic, Qabbalistic, and Rosicrucian Symbolical Philosophy**_ is a classic esoteric encyclopedia written by Manly P. Hall, first published in 1928.

This work is Hall's _magnum opus_ and contains almost fifty chapters, each dense with esoteric knowledge, and more than 200 illustrations. He comprehensively covers many subjects, examples being:

*   [[Cabala vs. Kabbalah|Qabbala]]
*   [[Alchemy]]
*   The [[Tarot|tarot]]
*   Ceremonial magic
*   Neo-Platonic philosophy
*   Pythagorean philosophy
*   Mystery religions
*   Thoth Hermes Trismegistus
*   The Hiramic legend
*   the Tree of the Sephiroth
*   Mystic Christianity
*   The theory of [[Rosicrucianism]] and Freemasonry

While there is some outdated information in the book, it remains a very useful resource on esoteric matters.
