_**The Crack in the Cosmic Egg: New Constructs of Mind and Reality**_ is a classic work by Joseph Chilton Pearce, first published in 1971.

Pearce's work is a [[New Age]] classic and challenges the present conceptions of what it means to be human and to live in human-made reality.

He utilizes the metaphor of a "Cosmic Egg" to describe that the reality that defines us (and is defined by us) and how it is limited and self-limiting construction. In other words, our ideas/beliefs of what the world is form a "eggshell" of thought in which we reside. It is "structured by the mind’s drive for a logical ordering of its universe".[\[1\]](#cite_note-1) He shares with the reader a number of examples (Jesus, [[Don Juan|Don Juan Matus]], etc.) to demonstrate that our reality (Cosmic Egg) can be changed.
