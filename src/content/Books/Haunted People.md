_**Haunted People: The Story Of The Poltergeist Down The Centuries**_ is a book by paranormal researchers Hereward Carrington and Nandor Fodor, first published in 1951.

This 220+ pages book is broken down into two parts, with Part 1 being written by Dr. Carrington, which brings the reader to look at "The March of the Poltergeist", "The Phelps Case", "A Jinn in Transylvania", and "A Poltergeist in Mauritius". He emphasizes that poltergeist phenomena are often associated with the presence of young persons (specifically young girls) who are entering puberty.

Dr. Fodor wrote the second part of the book, focusing on "The Saragossa Ghost", "The Bell Witch", "The Talking Mongoose" with two chapters dealing on psychoanalytic approach to problems of occultism and psychoanalytical discussion on poltergeists. Differing from the first author, Fodor places poltergeist disturbances on a broader causal base where he considers them to be real but originating in schizophrenia or other mental disorders.

Also, both authors wrote a short 44-page booklet entitled "Historic Poltergeists", which became a basic ground to which they have expanded and complied a number of known cases for this book. This is a psychoanalytical study of one of the most intriguing and terrifying paranormal phenomena: Poltergeists.
