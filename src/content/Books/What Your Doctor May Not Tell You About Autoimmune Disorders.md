_**What Your Doctor May Not Tell You About Autoimmune Disorders**_ is a book by Stephen B. Edelson and Deborah Mitchell, published in 2003, which discusses the most common types of autoimmune diseases, outlining symptoms, causes, and risk factors with an addition of Edelson's own revolutionary program for treating the root of all autoimmune disorders.

According to Laura Knight-Jadczyk's [review](http://www.amazon.com/review/R21SLKQ6NQ8G4V/ref=cm_cr_dp_title) on Amazon:

> This book is engaging and full of cutting edge science as well as practical advice. Dr. Edelson explains some very complex physiological systems in clear language that even impressed my doctor who said she never did understand it as well even in medical school! Not only that, but Edelson was a pioneer in a field that is now being taken up by other high profile doctors such as Mark Hyman, author of _The Ultra-Mind Solution_. They are saying pretty much the same things, only Edelson said it first.

> Like any other diet or health book, there is a particular focus and some of his ideas and protocols won't work for everyone. But, by and large, Dr. Edelson manages to connect things together in a very comprehensive way, and those people who will not benefit from his approach are, I would think, a vanishing minority.
> 
> One thing that struck me and convinced me that Dr. Edelson really knew his stuff was his mention of the inflamed blood vessel lumps that appear in the forearms of individuals who suffer rheumatoid arthritis. I've had these lumps for years, I have rheumatoid arthritis, and no other doctor has ever been able to tell me what those lumps are. What's more, they have begun to disappear simply from following the protocol in Dr. Edelson's book. My doctor is even willing to experiment with the anti-biotic treatment for my condition and I'm looking forward to even greater improvement than I have achieved already, and that will be something! I'm already almost 90% free of pain and my good days now far outnumber my bad days!
