_**Many Voices: The Autobiography of a Medium**_ is an autobiography by Eileen J. Garrett, first published in 1968.

Eileen J. Garrett (1893 - 1970) was an Irish trance medium and her abilities were tested by a number of parapsychologist and paranormal researchers in 1930s and 1940s during her stay in the United States. She also founded the Parapsychology Foundation in 1951, which promotes organized scientific researches into parapsychology and publishes _International Journal of Parapsychology_.

In this book, the author discusses her life and her psychic abilities as well as touches on many themes relating to the paranormal phenomena. She does not give into the idea that the "voices" that was speaking through her while she was in a trance were "separate entities", but that very likely they were "aspects" of her own self.

In her autobiography, Garrett gave her views on mediumship:[\[1\]](#cite_note-1)

> "If I were to sum up my present views of mediumship, I would be inclined to interpret these powers as a manifestation of individual supersensitivity. As I have already indicated, I found my own powers to be intimately related to the events and experiences of my earliest childhood; and it may be that the mediumistic gift is an extreme intensification of infant awareness and response during the proverbial period, carried over into adulthood. In this respect, the mediumistic power may be of a similar order to those of the child prodigy in music or in mathematics. The prodigy's phenomenal abilities obviously cannot be explained wholly on the basis of something that is consciously learned. It must inevitably spring from unconscious forces, perhaps including racial memories, that we do not fully understand."

Garrett was mentioned in a number of articles and books, including Jon Klimo's _[[Channeling, Investigations on Receiving Information from Paranormal Sources|Channeling: Investigations on Receiving Information from Paranormal Sources]]_ and Nandor Fodor's _[[Encyclopaedia of Psychic Science]]_.
