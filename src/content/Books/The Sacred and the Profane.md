_**The Sacred and the Profane: The Nature of Religion**_ is a scholarly work on spirituality by Mircea Eliade, first published in 1959. It consists of four chapters with an introduction and a chronological survey.

This study essentially picks up where Rudolf Otto's _The Idea of the Holy_ left off where the concept of the sacred is explicated through its relation to its exact counterpart, the profane.

As Eliade writes in his Introduction:[\[1\]](#cite_note-1)

> After forty years, Otto's analyses have not lost their value; readers of this book will profit by reading and reflecting on them. But in the following pages we adopt a different perspective. We propose to present the phenomenon of the sacred in all its complexity, and not only in so far as it is _irrational._ What will concern us is not the relation between the rational and nonrational elements of religion but _the sacred in its entirely_. The first possible definition of the _sacred_ is that it is _the opposite of the profane_. The aim of the following pages is to illustrate and define this opposition between sacred and profane.

In this book, the author argues that any religious thought relies on a strict distinction between the sacred and the profane.
