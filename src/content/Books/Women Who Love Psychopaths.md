_**Women Who Love Psychopaths: Inside the Relationships of Inevitable Harm With Psychopaths, Sociopaths & Narcissists**_ is a book by Sandra L. Brown, first published in 2008. It covers the dynamics between [[Psychopaths|psychopaths]] (and other character-disturbed people) and the victims who end up in relationships with them.

It seems that the most empathic and good-hearted people are often the ones targeted by psychopaths for victimization; and such people, as a result of their compassionate and generally trusting nature, tend to be the most vulnerable to emotional manipulation.

This book focuses on female victims and male psychopaths, though it can likewise be helpful for understanding male victims and female psychopaths.
