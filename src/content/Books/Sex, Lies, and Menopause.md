_**Sex, Lies, and Menopause: The Shocking Truth About Synthetic Hormones and the Benefits of Natural Alternatives**_ is a book by T. S. Wiley with Julie Taguchi and Bent Formby, published in 2003, which is about about the necessity of natural hormone replacement with bio-identical hormones taken in rythmic cylical doses.

In this book, Wiley proposed that hormone imbalances were caused humans straying from "natural" rhythms of light, seasonal eating and child birth and they in turn cause many age-related diseases. Then, she advises women to turn to natural hormone-replacement therapy (derived from plants, not drugs) to help with elevating their estrogen level for greater energy, libido, and intellectual capacity.
