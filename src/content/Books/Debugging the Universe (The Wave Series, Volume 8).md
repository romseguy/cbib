_**Debugging the Universe: The Hero's Journey**_ is the eighth volume of _The Wave_ series by [[Laura Knight-Jadczyk]], first published in 2012.

_Debugging the Universe_ continues the series, starting with chapter 64 and ends with chapter 72.

This volume brings the reader to experience the path of self-development and growth of knowledge, which goes by several names: [[The Path of the Fool]], the Hero's Journey, or the [[Great Work]]. It is fraught with difficult lessons and intense struggle, and the author takes the reader into the heart of what it means to be human, from the molecules of human DNA to life purpose and true place in the universe as well as everything that separates us from embodying that higher potential.

The author explores the real-life applications of the [[archetype|Hero's archetype]], the relevance of neuroscience and the "molecules of emotion", the hidden meaning behind the enigmatic symbols of esoterica, and what it meas to live inside a complex system: the universal breath of chaos and order.
