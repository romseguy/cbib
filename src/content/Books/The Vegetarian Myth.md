_**The Vegetarian Myth: Food, Justice and Sustainability**_ is a book by Lierre Keith, first published in 2009. It discusses, with scientific backing, the problems with vegetarianism and veganism, both in terms of health and ethics.

Keith explores how agriculture as commonly practiced around the world ultimately destroys the very conditions required for life. Ecosystems are destroyed, top soil is depleted, and artificial irrigation eventually increases salt levels in the soil to the point where the land turns into desert. A more general and ultimate point is that it is impossible to eat without the taking of other life. It happens in one way or another, and the strictest vegan cannot escape it. Ethical vegetarianism and veganism are based on noble, but unfortunately misguided ideals. To do the least harm possible, and to treat nature with the greatest respect possible, requires another approach.

Also discussed is health and nutrition. _The Vegetarian Myth_ provides a great summary of the science showing the benefits of a low-carbohydrate, high-fat diet, and the problems with exclusively plant-based diets.
