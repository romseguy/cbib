_**Detoxify or Die**_ is a book by Sheery A. Rogers, published in 2002, which presents a strong case that our main toxic load comes from our environment and provides a sources and types of toxicity that are damaging our bodies.

In this book, the author discusses the importance of treating the causes of disease, the chemicals to avoid in food, cleaning, personal care products, the impact of each of the major chemicals in the body, the issues with the most common prescribed drugs, the benefits of a daily detox cocktail and of a daily FIR sauna.

It is a highly recommended reading, along with Sidney MacDonald Baker's _[Detoxification and Healing: The Key to Optimal Health]([[Detoxification and Healing The Key to Optimal Health]])_, to give one the tools and knowledge one needs in order to cleanse and detoxify the body.
