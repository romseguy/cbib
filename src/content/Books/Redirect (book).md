_**Redirect**_ is a book by Timothy D. Wilson, first published in 2011 as _Redirect: The Surprising New Science of Psychological Change_. It describes how the attitudes and behaviors of people can be changed by influencing the stories – or narratives – they tell themselves.

An important subject discussed in the book is how expressive writing can be used to deal with emotional trauma, and misconceptions about which kinds of interventions are helpful in the aftermath of traumatic events. (Commonly used group debriefing techniques such as CISD, employed immediately in the aftermath of traumatic events, are not only ineffective but can actually worsen the impact of the trauma.)

The rest of the book deals mainly with addressing societal issues, using principles of influencing the narratives people form, rather than with methods for individual psychological change. Here, too, the book contrasts what research has found to be effective with misguided interventions that are commonly used.

The book has more recently been published under the title _Redirect: Changing the Stories We Live By_.

Expressive writing and psychological health
-------------------------------------------

Writing for 20 minutes on four consecutive days, focusing on the major traumatic or otherwise stressful events of one's life, can be of great benefit. In translating the experiences into language, and placing them in a meaningful context – "making sense" of them – they become less "stuck" in the mind, and the same goes for the emotions connected to them. This can lead to significant improvements in overall well-being. Apart from change on the psychological level, physiological health also often improves, which is unsurprising in light of the mind-body connection.
