_**The Hermetic Brotherhood of Luxor: Initiatic and Historical Documents of an Order of Practical Occultism**_ is a volume-length scholarly and academic study of a 19th Century initiatic occult organization by Joscelyn Godwin, Christian Chanel, and John P. Deveney, first published in 1995.

The Hermetic Brotherhood of Luxor was an active organization, established by Max Th√©on, in the last decades of the 19th century and the only order of its time that taught practical occultism in the Western Mystery Tradition. Its membership included a number of influential individuals, including John Dee, Aleister Crowley, and Israel Regardie.

This work is the first complete and undistorted account, providing accurate texts of the "teachings" involved and traces its origins, founders, and practices.

This work will encourage the reader to put to rest any illusions about Helena Blavatsky.
