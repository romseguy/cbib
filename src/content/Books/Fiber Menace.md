_**Fiber Menace**_ is a book by Konstantin Monastyrsky, first published in 2005. It discusses an important and often overlooked piece of the dietary puzzle: the detrimental role of fiber. Excess fiber is damaging to the gut in several ways, and also reduces absorption of nutrients. Over time, unhealthily enlarged stools may permanently stretch and damage the gut (including its nerve endings), resulting in chronic constipation and dependence on fiber.

This book is of particular importance for people with severe gut issues of many kinds, where a reduction in fiber intake is often very helpful, or even crucial, for healing. Such people are often adviced by less well-informed doctors to increase their fiber intake, which can lead to worsening of symptoms and to irreversible damage to the gut.
