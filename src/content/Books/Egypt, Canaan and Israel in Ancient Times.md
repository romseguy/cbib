_**Egypt, Canaan and Israel in Ancient Times**_ is a scholarly work by Egyptologist Donald B. Redford, first published in 1992, which explores the relationship between Egypt and Canaan/Palestine/Israel from prehistory down to the destruction of Jerusalem in 586 B.C.

There are four parts in this book, with the total of fifteen chapters, excluding an introduction and an epilogue. The first part explores the prehistory of Egypt and the Levant to the Hyksos in Egypt, drawing on archaeological and textual evidence, and the second section focuses on the New Kingdom of Egypt and its Empire in Asia. The third part discusses the attacks of Libyans and Sea Peoples on Egypt, and the final part of the book addresses the relations between Egypt and the Hebrew Kingdoms to the fall of Judah in 586 B.C.

The author presents a case that the experiences of the Hyksos in Ancient Egypt laid out a foundation of myths in Canaanite culture, leading to the story of Exodus.
