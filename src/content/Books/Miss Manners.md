The _**Miss Manners**_ articles and books by American journalist Judith Martin describe, in a humorous way, how to be "excruciatingly correct".

In the Cassiopaea Forum discussion on [Cassiopaea Forum: External Considering and Good Manners](https://cassiopaea.org/forum/index.php/topic,32518.0.html), _Miss Manners_ has been recommended as a "must read" for forum members and beyond. While written for the American audience, readers in many other countries may still benefit; a fair portion of the advice may still apply (one would have to use own basic cultural knowledge and supplement the information as needed), and through her examples, she demonstrates basic principles and a general thoughtfulness.

Judith Martin has written an advice column, distributed three times a week by Universal Uclick, in more than 200 newspapers worldwide since 1978.

She has also written numerous _Miss Manners_ books, including:

*   _Miss Manners' Guide to Excruciatingly Correct Behavior_
*   _Miss Manners Rescues Civilization: From Sexual Harassment, Frivolous Lawsuits, Dissing and Other Lapses in Civility_
