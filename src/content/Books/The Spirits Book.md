_**The Spirits' Book**_ is a book by Allan Kardec, first published in 1857. Followed by _[[The Book on Mediums]]_ (1861), this book is the first in a series of five books from the author, known as the "Spiritist Codification". It contains four "books" with twenty-nine chapters in all.

This work is structured as a collection of questions and answers between the author and a group of spirits ("The Spirit of Truth") on the origin of the spirits, the purpose of the life and the universe, evil and good, and the afterlife. Kardec grouped these sessions by theme or subject in the book.

This book is considered to be a classic among the spiritists. While dated, it remains a useful source.
