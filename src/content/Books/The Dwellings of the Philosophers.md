_**Les Demeures Philosophales**_ (_The Dwellings of the Philosophers_) is a second and last known work by [[Fulcanelli]], first published in French in Paris in 1929, with thirty-nine illustrations by Jean-Julien Champagne. This two-volume/500-plus-page treatise consisted of further information on classical architecture and alchemy from his first work, _[[The Mystery of the Cathedrals]]_.

Written in a cryptic and erudite manner, the author describes the features and history and meaning of various architectural details found in buildings of Alchemical significance. From this work, it appears that Fulcanelli cannot have inferred his expositions of alchemy from the art itself, rather he is using this art as a springboard for discussing a field of knowledge that he has been separately initiated to. Both this book and _The Mystery of the Cathedrals_ give instructions (scattered in clues) to "truth seekers" on achieving [[The Work|the Work]].

[[Laura Knight-Jadczyk]] discusses _The Dwellings of the Philosophers_ and the subject of alchemy in her _[[The Secret History of the World]]_ and in the [Grail](http://cassiopaea.org/2011/02/22/the-grail-quest-and-the-destiny-of-man-i/) and _[Wave](http://cassiopaea.org/2010/05/08/the-wave-chapter-1-riding-the-wave/)_ series.
