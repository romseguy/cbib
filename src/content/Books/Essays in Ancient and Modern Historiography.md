This work is a collection of selected twenty-one essays, supplementing readings of writers in the Greek, Jewish, and Roman traditions, such as Tacitus and Polybius, with writings that focus on later historians, such as Vico and Croce.

This book contributes to an important understanding about historiography and ancient historians.
