_**The Fire from Within**_ is the seventh book by [[Carlos Castaneda]], first published in 1984. The book introduces two important ideas: the "[petty tyrant‎]([[Petty tyrant]])", in [[Don Juan]]'s teaching that the seers of old learned to face the [[Unknown and unknowable|unknown]] by dealing with the petty tyrants of everyday life; and "[stalking]([[Stalking]])", where a [[Warrior|warrior]] exercises the virtues of control, [discipline]([[Discipline]]), forebearance, and timing towards the petty tyrants.

The book is Castaneda's narrative about the struggle against [[Self-importance or self-love|self-importance]] in order to be able to face the "petty tyrants" of our lives. For, in esoteric strivings, becoming able to deal with ordinary life things is first priority, a basic necessity.

Notable quotes
--------------

*   "Think about it: what weakens us is feeling offended by the deeds and misdeeds of our fellow men. Our self-importance requires that we spend most of our lives offended by someone."

*   "Petty tyrants take themselves with deadly seriousness while warriors do not. What usually exhausts us is the wear and tear on our self-importance. Any man who has an iota of pride is ripped apart by being made to feel worthless."

*   "Self-importance can't be fought with niceties."

*   "A warrior knows that he is waiting and what he is waiting for. Right there is the great joy of warriorship."
