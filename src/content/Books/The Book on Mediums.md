_**The Book on Mediums: Guide for Mediums and Invocators**_ is a book by Allan Kardec, first published in 1861. This book is a follow-up to _[[The Spirits Book]]_ (1857) and it is the second in a series of five books by the author that are known as the "Spiritist Codification". The book runs for thirty-three chapters.

This book explains how to apply the author's principles of his practical science of spiritism in order to become a medium. In other words, it is intended to be a guide to mediumship for mediums and those interested in the spirit world.

The author covers the different types of mediumship including: spirit manifestations, table-turning, haunted houses, apparitions, psychography, telekinesis and so on. It also explains how to deal with manifestations and how to guard against frauds, charlatans, and skeptics as well as warns against the dangers of frivolous mediumship and possession/obsession that are often experienced with sweet messages coming from the "spirits".

While Kardec's work is dated, it remains a very useful source on the subject.
