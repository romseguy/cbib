_**Blink: The Power of Thinking Without Thinking**_ is a book by Malcolm Gladwell, first published in 2005. It presents research findings on the role of the adaptive unconscious in our lives, including the more positive aspects of unconscious information processing ("thinking without thinking"). It can often notice and solve problems more efficiently and creatively than an analytical approach which systematically considers more information.

This book is a good supplement to _[[Strangers to Ourselves]]_ and _[[Thinking, Fast and Slow]]_, which focus more on the flaws and biases of unconscious information processing, and on how we are blind to what influences us and to our own motivations and personality.
