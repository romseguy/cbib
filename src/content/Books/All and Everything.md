> **SECOND SERIES:** Three books under the common title of "Meetings with Remarkable Men."
> 
> **THIRD SERIES:** Four books under the common title of "Life is Real Only Then, When ‘I Am.'"
> 
> All written according to entirely new principles of logical reasoning and strictly directed towards the solution of the following three cardinal problems:
> 
> **FIRST SERIES:** To destroy, mercilessly, without any compromises whatsoever, in the mentation and feelings of the reader, the beliefs and views, by centuries rooted in him, about everything existing in the world.
> 
> **SECOND SERIES:** To acquaint the reader with the material required for a new creation and to prove the soundness and good quality of it.
> 
> **THIRD SERIES:** To assist the arising, in the mentation and in the feelings of the reader, of a veritable, non-fantastic representation not of that illusory world which he now perceives, but of the world existing in reality.
