_**Life Is Religion: 12 Daily Exercises for Mind, Body, and Soul**_ is a small book assembled by Cassiopaea Forum members ([[Quantum Future Group]]), published in 2013 by Red Pill Press.

This book grew out of the discussion following the [23 March 2013 C's session](https://cassiopaea.org/forum/index.php/topic,30858.0.html). It brings together key points on The Work, or Fourth Way, and is a handy summary to refer to.

It guides the reader through 12 daily exercises for spiritual, mental, and physical well-being. Lushly illustrated, each section includes practical advice and inspirational quotations, with suggestions for healthy eating and activities to heighten self-awareness and deal with the stresses of everyday life. Inspired by QFG's ongoing research and Laura Knight-Jadczyk's [[Cassiopaean Experiment]], _Life Is Religion_ is a concise yet comprehensive guide to living a life of truth and compassion.

The name of the book was inspired by the following quote from the C's:

Life is religion. Life experiences reflect how one interacts with God. Those who are asleep are those of little faith in terms of their interaction with the creation. Some people think that the world exists for them to overcome or ignore or shut out. For those individuals, the worlds will cease. They will become exactly what they give to life. They will become merely a dream in the "past". People who pay strict attention to objective reality right and left, become the reality of the "Future".
