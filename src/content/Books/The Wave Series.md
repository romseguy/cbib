_The Wave_ is a book in 8 volumes that covers concepts and material integral to [Cassiopaea Forum](https://cassiopaea.org/forum/index.php). The reader might wish to begin with _The Wave_ series in order to understand the workings and the coherence of the forum.

[[Laura Knight-Jadczyk|Laura Knight-Jadczyk‎‎]] wrote the series in the process of answering readers' questions about the [[Cassiopaean Experiment]], and the project snowballed into something that covers an incredible range of material. The volumes cover esoteric concepts, history, the state of our world, matters of conspiracy and high strangeness, psychology and neurology, and much more. Many parts of it also describe personal experiences, and through this, illustrate the concepts discussed.

In short, _The Wave_ has something relating to almost every area of knowledge explored by the network - the exceptions are mostly in the latest discoveries - and as such, it is essential background material. It is also worth re-reading once in a while as new knowledge is gained, as broader and deeper understanding is then made possible. It is available both in print and for free on [Cassiopaea.org](http://cassiopaea.org/2010/05/08/the-wave-chapter-1-riding-the-wave/).

"[[The Wave]]" is a term used to describe a Macro-cosmic Quantum Wave Collapse producing both a physical and a "metaphysical" change to the Earth’s cosmic environment theorized to be statistically probable sometime in the early 21st century. This event is variously described by other sources as the planetary shift to 4th density, shift of the ages, the harvest etc., and is most often placed around the end of 2012. The _Wave_ series includes a UFO abduction account, a transcript of an actual hypnotic regression session, that refers to a global cataclysmic change. Please note that [[FOTCM]] do not, however, subscribe to the notion that such events can be exactly predicted as to whether or when they might occur. [[Quantum physics]] talks about statistical probabilities, not prophetic certainties.
