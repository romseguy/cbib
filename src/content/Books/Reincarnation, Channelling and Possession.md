_**Reincarnation, Channeling and Possession: A Parapsychologist's Handbook**_ is a book by parapsychologist Loyd Auerbach, first published in 1993.

It consists of five sections with 3-5 chapters in each section with an addition of interviews with a number of researchers and psychologists, including Jon Klimo. The first four sections focuses on mind/spirit/soul, reincarnation, channeling, and the possession respectively. The last section is a discussion on the field of parapsychology and the state of research in early 1990s. He also includes appendices, where he provides the reader with a basic information on dealing with past lives, consulting a channeler, and dealing with the possession.

The book is a good primer for understanding the three phenomena: reincarnation, channeling and possession. It is listed as one of recommended readings in [A Survey of Channeling](http://cassiopaea.org/2010/09/14/a-survey-of-channeling/).
