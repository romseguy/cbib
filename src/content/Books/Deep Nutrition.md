_**Deep Nutrition: Why Your Genes Need Traditional Food**_ is a book by Catherine Shanahan and Luke Shanahan, published in 2009, which goes into the studies of "epigenetics" and how much influence diet and nutrition has on the proper expression and functioning of the genes (and the effects carried over generations).

The blurb on [Amazon](http://www.amazon.com/Deep-Nutrition-Your-Genes-Traditional/dp/0615228380) gives a good overall description of the contents:

> _Deep Nutrition_ illustrates how our ancestors used nourishment to sculpt their anatomy, engineering bodies of extraordinary health and beauty. The length of our limbs, the shape of our eyes, and the proper function of our organs are all gifts of our ancestor's collective culinary wisdom.
> 
> Citing the foods of traditional cultures from the Ancient Egyptians and the Maasai to the Japanese and the French, the Shanahans identify four food categories all the world's healthiest diets have in common, the Four Pillars of World Cuisine. Using the latest research in physiology and genetics, Dr. Shanahan explains why your family's health depends on eating these foods. In a world of competing nutritional ideologies, _Deep Nutrition_ gives us the full picture, empowering us to take control of our destiny in ways we might never have imagined.
