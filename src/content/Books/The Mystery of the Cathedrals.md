_**Le Mystère des Cathédrales: et l'interprétation ésotérique des symboles hermétiques du grand œuvre**_ (_Mystery of the Cathedrals: Esoteric Interpretation of Hermetic Symbols of The Great Work_) is a _magnum opus_ by [[Fulcanelli]], first published in French in Paris in 1926, with prefaces by Eugène Canseliet; a hermetic study of French Gothic cathedrals, which details the hidden code of [alchemy]([[Alchemy]]).

Written in a cryptic and erudite manner, this work reveals the purpose of Phonetic Cabala within the alchemistic works as well as the process of the [[Great Work]]. From this work, it appears that Fulcanelli cannot have inferred his expositions of alchemy from the art itself, rather he is using this art as a springboard for discussing a field of knowledge that he has been separately initiated to.

[[Laura Knight-Jadczyk]] discusses _Mystery of the Cathedrals_ and the subject of alchemy in her _[[The Secret History of the World]]_ and in the [Grail](http://cassiopaea.org/2011/02/22/the-grail-quest-and-the-destiny-of-man-i/) and _[Wave](http://cassiopaea.org/2010/05/08/the-wave-chapter-1-riding-the-wave/)_ series.
