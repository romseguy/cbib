_**Active Side of Infinity**_ is the last book by [[Carlos Castaneda]], first published in 1998. [[FOTCM|FOTCM]] considers this book to be Castaneda's best work.

This book covers the very important theme of the [[Predator's mind]], among other things. This idea is further connected to the ideas of the [Fall]([[Fall of man]]), and of humanity being food for [[Fourth density service to self being|higher-density STS beings]], or "[[Food for the Moon]]" in Gurdjieff's terms. In terms of psychology, is also related to the basic issues of negative imprinting, psychological traumatization and defenses, and the formation in us of a [[Personality (Fourth Way)|false self]] which takes the place of who we would be by our real nature.

Castaneda described this book as "a collection of the memorable events in my life," which he gathered at the recommendation of [[Don Juan]]. A process of collecting the memorable events in one's life, [[Recapitulation|recapitulation]] is a way of stirring "caches of energy that exist within the self," and making that energy available.

A compilation of Don Juan's teachings from this book can be found [here](http://www.prismagems.com/castaneda/donjuan12.html).
