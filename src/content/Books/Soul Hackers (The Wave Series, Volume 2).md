_**Soul Hackers: The Hidden Hands Behind the New Age Movement**_ is the second volume of _The Wave_ series by [[Laura Knight-Jadczyk]], first appeared on the internet in late March of 2000 with the latest book publication in 2010.

This volume picks up where [[Riding the Wave (The Wave Series, Volume 1)|_Riding the Wave_]] left off, starting with chapter 10 through 19. Here, the author deals with the issues of [[Religion]], of binding the lower self with the Truly Spiritual by learning the lessons of life in [[third density]] and coming to an understanding of the true nature of simple karmic understandings.

The author goes into a concept of [[You create your own reality|"creating your own reality"]], the issues of [[New Age]] movement, including [[Reiki]], the issues of channeling, and the "soul hackers" - the "forces" behind the events that influence human lives in such insidious ways. She ended this volume with Dr. D. Corydon Hammond's infamous Greenbaum lecture and its implications for the New Age community.
