_**Comets and the Horns of Moses**_ is the second volume in the series _The Secret History of the World_ by [[Laura Knight-Jadczyk]], and was published in 2013.

This second volume picks up the threads of the first volume with an analysis of the Biblical character of Moses – his possible true history and nature – and the cyclical nature of cometary bombardment and related catastrophes in Earth's history. It examines how human culture and beliefs have changed in response to overwhelming disaster, and how and why history has been falsified to erase such disasters from common knowledge. In light of the past, it also examines the situation of our current civilization, showing that the time seems near for it to experience what past civilizations have: destruction by cometary bombardment, plague, and other related disastrous events.

The examination of the falsification of history (including why the masses of the past so readily accepted the fabrications that were spoon-fed to them by the elites of the day) is based on recent psychological and cognitive research as well as a neoteric look at the origin of astrology and religions.
