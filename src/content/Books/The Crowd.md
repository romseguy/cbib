_**The Crowd: A Study of the Popular Mind**_ is a pivotal work in the field of group psychology by French social psychologist Gustave Le Bon, first published in 1895, which studies the susceptibility of crowds to manipulation, control, and misdirection towards destructive ends.

This book describes the susceptibility of crowds to manipulation - how they can be, and are, hystericized and controlled towards destructive ends. It is important reading for any individual who works with people. And in these times, you never know when you will find yourself in a "crowd out of control" situation and may need to have your wits about you not just for your own sake, but for the sake of innocents around you.

Taken together with John F. Schumaker's _Corruption of Reality_, it presents a rather grim picture of what can or cannot be done as far as changing the destructive trajectory of human history.
