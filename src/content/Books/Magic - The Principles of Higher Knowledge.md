_**Magic: The Principles of Higher Knowledge**_ is a book by Christian theosopher Karl von Eckartshausen, first published in German in 1788, conveying the author's thoughts on metaphysical, religious, and theosophical aspects of life.

Readers are advised not to misunderstand the word "magic" in the book's title; this work is not similar to modern "[[New Age]]"/"self-help" books dealing with "magic", and it is not concerned with rituals or simplistic "secrets" for transforming one's life. It is a book about principles of life and existence, each chapter defining and describing a "principle".

It is recommended and useful reading.
