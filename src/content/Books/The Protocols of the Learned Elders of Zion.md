_**The Protocols of the Elders of Zion**_ or _**The Protocols of the Meetings of the Learned Elders of Zion**_ is an anti-Semitism text alleging a Jewish and Masonic plot to achieve world domination, first published in Russia in 1903.

The text supposedly was written by a secret group of Jews known as "the Elders of Zion"; the document underlies 24 protocols that are supposedly followed by the Jewish people.

This document is analyzed in Douglas Reed's _[[The Controversy of Zion]]_.

The _Protocols_ can be read on [Internet Archive](https://archive.org/details/TheProtocolsOfTheLearnedEldersOfZion).
