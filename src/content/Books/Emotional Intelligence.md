_**Emotional Intelligence: Why It Can Matter More Than IQ**_ is a book by psychologist Daniel Goleman, first published in 1995. It is the precursor to the author's 2006 book _[[Social Intelligence]]_ and conveys the "big picture" of the importance of emotional intelligence.

Emotional Intelligence (or E.I.) is a term used to describe the ability or a skill of a person to recognize their own and other people's emotions, to discriminate between different feelings and label them appropriately, and to use emotional information to guide thinking and behavior. In this book, Goleman developed an argument that emotional intelligence, or non-cognitive skills, is as important as I.Q. for success, including in academic, professional, social, and interpersonal aspects of one's life.
